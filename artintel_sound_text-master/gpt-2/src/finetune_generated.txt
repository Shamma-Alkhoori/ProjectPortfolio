I could feel at the time. There was no way of knowing. Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing. As free as the wind. Hopefully learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing.
Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Cause the night belongs to us. Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our bed 'til the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. With love we sleep,. with doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns. Without you, oh I cannot live,. forgive the yearning burning. I believe it's time to heal to feel,. so take me now, take me now, take me now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us
These are. These are days you'll remember. Never before and never since, I promise. Will the whole world be warm as this. And as you feel it,. You'll know it's true. That you - you are blessed and lucky. It's true - that you. Are touched by something. That will grow and bloom in you. These are days you'll remember. When May is rushing over you. With desire to be part of the miracles. You see in every hour. You'll know it's true. That you are blessed and lucky. It's true that you are touched. By something that will grow and bloom in you. These are days. These are the days you might fill. With laughter until you break. These days you might feel. A shaft of light. Make its way across your face. And when you do. You'll know how it was meant to be. See the signs and know their meaning. You'll know how it was meant to be. Hear the signs and know they're speaking. To you, to you

Trudging slowly over wet sand. Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen. This is a coastal town. That they forgot to close down. Armagedon - come armagedon come armagedon come. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Hide on a promanade. Etch on a post card:. How I dearly wish I was not here. In the seaside town. That they forgot to bomb. Come, come nuclear bomb!. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Trudging back over pebbles and sand. And a strange dust lands on your hands. (and on your face). Everyday is like sunday. Win yourself a cheap tray. Share some grease tea with me. Everyday is silent and grey
Don't talk, I will listen. Don't talk, you keep your distance. For I'd rather hear some truth tonight. Than entertain your lies,. So take you poison silently. Let me be let me close my eyes. Don't talk, I'll believe it. Don't talk, listen to me instead,. I know that if you think of it,. Both long enough and hard. The drink you drown your troubles. In is the trouble you're in now. Talk talk talk about it,. If you talk as if you care. But when your talk is over. Tilt that bottle in the air,. Tossing back more than your share. Don't talk, I can guess it. Don't talk, well now your restless. And you need somewhere to put the blame. For how you feel inside. You'll look for a close. And easy mark and you'll see me as fair game. Talk talk talk about it,. Talk as if you care. But when your talk is over tilt. That bottle in the air. Tossing back more than your share. You talk talk talk about it,. You talk as if you care. I'm marking every word. And can tell this time for sure,. Your talk is the finest I have heard. So don't talk, I'll be sleeping,. Let me go on dreaming. How your eyes they glow so fiercely. I can tell your inspired. By the name you just chose for me. Now what was it?. O, never mind it. We will talk talk. Talk about this when your head is clear. I'll discuss this in the morning,. But until then you may talk but I won't hear
Well they left then in the morning, a hundred pairs of wings. In the light moved together in the colors of the morning. I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone.. Across the marshes, across the fields below.. I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below.. If only to take me with them there,. Tell me the part that shinesIn your heart on the wind.. And the reeds blew in the morning.. Take me along to the places. You've gone when my eyes looked away.. Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning.. Tell me the part that shines in your heart. And the rays of love forever,. Please take me there..

On bended kneeI've looked through every window then.. Touched the bottom, the night a sleepless day instead. A day when love came,came easy like what's lost now found.. Beneath a blinding light that would surround.. We were without, in doubt. We were about saving for a rainy day.. I crashed through mirrors,. I crashed through floors of laughter then.. In a blind scene, no ties would moor us to this room.. A day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found.. And you would save me, and I held you like you were my child.. If I were you, defiant you, alone upon a troubled way.. I would send my heart to you. To save it for a rainy day..
For whom do the bells toll. When sentenced to die. The stuttering rifles. Will stifle the cry. The monstrous anger. The fear's rapid rattle. A desert inferno. Kids dying like cattle. Don't tell me. We're not prepared. I've seen today's marine. He's eighteen and he's eager. He can be quite mean. No mock'ries for them. No prayers or bells. The demented choirs. The wailing of shells. The boys holding candles. On untraveled roads. The fear spreads like fire. As shrapnel explodes. I think it's wrong. To conscript our youth. Against their will. When plenty of our citizenry. Really like to kill. What sign posts will lead. To armageddon's fires. What bugles will call them. From crowded grey shires. The women sit quiet. With death on their minds. A slow dusk descending. The drawing of blinds. Make the hunters all line up. It's their idea of fun. And let those be forgiven. Who never owned a gun. Was it him or me. Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread.
She walks alone on the brick lane,. the breeze is blowing.. A year had changed her forever,. just like her grey home.. He used to live so close here,. we'd look for places I can't remember.. The world was safe when she knew him,. she tried to hold him, hold on forever.. For all that never happens and all that never will be,. a candle burning for the love we seldom keep.. The earth was raw in her fingers,. she overturned it.. Considered planting some flowers,. they wouldn't last long,. no one to tend them.. It's funny how these things go,. you were the answer to all the questions.. The memories made her weary,. she shuddered slowly,. she didn't want to.. As a distant summer he began to whisper,. and threw a smile her way.. She looked into the glass,. liquid surface showing that they were melding,. together present past.. So where can I go from here?. The color fading,. he didn't answer.. She felt him slip from her vision.. She tried to hold him, hold on forever.. So close forever,. in a silent frozen sleep..

You were looking away from me, western skies calling you.. Colors spilling, running dazzling you.. I was looking the other way, voices call from the east,. I saw my roots of the trees there planted at my feet.. It could be I'm searching for a place so small. with room for everything where worlds on worlds revolve.. But how can we wait?. I wouldn't hold you back.. suppose I was the clever one and words came easy to me.. I could say I was writing a song about you and me.. Maybe that verse is yet tobe found, but waits inside of me,. a secret room, a tangled web to unweave.. But how can we wait knowing our ways,. how can we hold on,. still you know it's not too late.
The color of the sky as far as I can see is coal grey.. Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again.. With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my lips as if I might cry.. Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so I breathe.. Lately it seems this big bed is where I never leave.. Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. Quiver in my voice as I cry,. "What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away.". I hear the sound of a noon bell chime. Now I'm far behind.. You've put in 'bout half a day while here I lie. with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my lip as if I might cry,. "What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away?". Do I need someone here to scold me. or do I need someone who'll grab and pull me out of this. four poster dull torpor pulling downward.. For it is such a long time since my better days.. I say my prayers nightly this will pass away.. The color of the sky is grey as I can see through the blinds.. Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again. with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my voice as I cry,. "What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away?". I shiver, quiver, and try to wake..
Oh,. Baby blankets and. Baby shoes,. Baby slippers,. Baby spoons,. Walls of baby blue. Dream child in my head. Is a nightmare born. In a borrowed bed. Now I know. Lightning strikes again. It struck me once,. Then struck me dead. My folly grows inside of me. I eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. Walk for two,. Breathe for two,. Eat for two, now. Well, the egg man. Fell down off his shelf. All the good king's men. With all their help. Struggled 'til the end. For a shell. They couldn't mend. You know. Where this will lead,. To hush and rock. In the nursery.

Each other in. A wicked world. Strong in some respects,. But she couldn't stand. For the way he begged. And gave in. Pride is for men. Young girls. Should run and. Hide instead. You risk the game. By taking dares with "yes". I eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. Eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. I walk for two. I'm stumbling. I walk for two. I'm stumbling.

[original version by Lulu]. Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone. But in my mind I know they will still live on and on. But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to. perfume?. It isn't easy but I'll try. If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky. In letters that would soar a thousand feet high. To Sir, With Love. The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end. And as I leave, I know that I am leaving my best friend. A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong. That's a lot to learn - what can I give you in return?. If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start. But I would rather you let me give my heart. To Sir, With Love. Those awkward years have hurried by - why do they fly away?. Why is it, sir, that children grow up to be people one day?. What takes the place of climbing trees and dirty knees in the world. outside?. What is there for you I can buy?. If you wanted the world I'd surround it with a wall. I'd scrawl in words with letters ten feet tall. To Sir, With Love.
That summer fields grew high with foxglove stalks and ivy.. Wild apple blossoms everywhere.. Emerald green like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as warm as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,. you'll never, you'll never know.. That summer fields grow high.. We made garland crowns in hiding, pulled stems of flowers from my hair.. Blue in the stream like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as bold as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,. you'll never, you'll never know.. You'll never know.. Violet serene like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as warm as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need.. You'll never, you'll never know.. You'll never know.. That summer fields grow high.. We had wildflower fever. We had to lay down where they grow.. How I've learned to hide, how I've locked inside, you'd be surprised if shown.. But you'll never, you'll never know..
[ music: Dennis Drew/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . Tell me what's gone wrong.. I tilt my head there, under the faucet, but when I turn it on -- dry as paper.. Call the neighbors.. Who's to blame for what's going on?. In the dark without a clue I'm just the same as you.. O, they tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy and there's been a small spill.. Not a lot, no, just a drop.. But there you are mistaken, you know you are.. I wonder just how long they knew our well was poisoned but they let us just drink on.. O, they tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy and there's been a small spill.. All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea.. Someone's been a bit untidy, they'll have it cleaned up in a week.. But the week is over and now it's grown into years since I was told that I should be calm, there's nothing to fear here.. But I drank that water for years, my wife and my children.. Tell me, where to now, if your fight for a bearable life can be fought and lost in you backyard?. O, don't tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy, that there's been a small spill.. All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea.. Someone's been a bit untidy, they'll have it cleaned up in a week..
[ Spoken intro from: Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey (by Lillian Schlissel) ]. "While the young folks were having their good times. some of the mothers were giving birth to their babies.. Three babies were born in our company that summer.. My cousin, Emily, gave birth to a son in Utah,. forty miles north of the Great Salt Lake one morning.. But the next morning she traveled on. 'til noon when a stop was made and another child was born,. this time Susan Mollmeyer.. And gave the baby the name Alice Nevada.". Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads.. Pass the lone church spire.. Pass the talking wire from where to who knows?. There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains.. Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces.. The land was free and the price was right.. Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly.. Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family.. I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.. Who were the homestead wives?. Who were the gold rush brides?. Does anybody know?. Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?. The land was free, yet it cost their lives.. In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters. they would moan as they would read accounts of. madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief..
Hey Jack Kerouac. I think of you mother. And all the tears she cried. She would cry for none other. Than her little boy lost in a little world that hated. And that dared to drag him down. Her little boy courageous. He chose his words from mouths of. Babes got lost in the world. The hip-flash slinging madmen. Steaming café flirts. They all spoke through you. Hey Jack, now for the tricky part. When you were the brightest star. Who were the shadows?. Of the San Francisco beat boys. You were the favourite. Now they sit and rattle their bones. And think of their blood stoned days. You chose your words from mouths of. Babes got lost in the world. The hip-flask slinging madmen. Steaming café flirts. In Chinatown, howling at night. Allen baby, why so jaded?. Have the boys all grown up. and their beauty faded?. Billy, what a saint they made you. You're just like Mary down in Mexico. On All Souls' Day. You chose your words from mouths of. Babes lost in the world. The cool junk booting madmen. Street minded girls. In Harlem, howling at night. What a tear stained shock of the world. You've gone away without saying. Goodbye.

Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand.

I believe it's time to heal to feel,. so take me now, take me now, take me now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us
[ 10,000 Maniacs ]. . [ unreleased song on Euro and Australian MTT CDS ]. I was thinking today. if you would remember. you'd choose to remember. what you left me out there in the cold. Days fading away. I see you so near. I hear your voice calling. it calls me from these pages to you. Beyond the blue. so sudden too soon. secrets we knew. And I was thinking today. if you would surrender. you'd choose to surrender. to feelings that you tried deserting. And if given the choice. I'd still wait for the moment. still wait for the moment. when I could have a hero like you. Beyond the blue. so sudden too soon. secrets we knew. Days are fading away. but I see you clear. I hear your voice calling. it calls me from these pages to you. Beyond the blue. so sudden too soon. secrets we knew.
I saw a big star running from me,. a world from a record on my bed.. Turn the tables on me,. what would happen if I fell to the tune of a dreamer,. to the tune of my heart?. A big start running from me,. I saw a world out sunning on my head.. Turn the tables on me now.. I would fall from heaven and ring your bell.. Baby, catch me in the middle of a lie.. The boys are out tonight,. yeah the boys are out tonight.. The big shots singin' from me,. I saw a world out sunning on my head.. Pity my heart signals:. center of a storm inside my head.. Center of my heart,. center of my out of time simple mind.. From the moon out my window a wink and a blink and a nod.. Had a wish on a start but now it's falling.. The boys are out tonight,. big skies above me signal in my horoscope it said:. never heed a caution,. never fought a lover,. never cross a street alone in the middle of a signal red,. middle of a drinker's heart,. middle of a big parade,. a signal in my horoscope..

[ Billy Bragg and Natalie Merchant ]. . Crowds gather round kneeling at the feet of common thieves. Hungry for the word, but God would never speak through such as these,. such as these. who offer healing hands and balms, and redemption, a few would cross. their palms. They'll tell your troubles to the Lord for how ever much you can afford. Hands holding hands in the circle of the sinners and the saints. Memories that linger from the cradle, placing puzzles in the grave,. in the grave. No mortal skin and bone can live on bread and circuses alone. The spirit needs, must drive the mystery of why you're alive. CHORUS:. They look and their Book and they read. But their cold hearts say, "Follow me". Dance in the dust in the frenzy of the desperately in need. Led by the voices of the men who invoke ritual to hide their greed,. hide their greed. Come every tongue, every eye across the crumbling earth and cracking skies. The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single. file. (Chorus). These men make a cage for the very souls that came here to be free. They turn off their lights for their tents they're fixing to leave. (Instrumental). Follow me. (Chorus 2x). They'll close their Book and leave, but you'll remain still in pain.
Music by 10,000 Maniacs - Lyrics by Mary Ramsey. Shards of glass cut through my gaze. broken streamers hanging at my legs. drunk and giddy full of fate. at the cabaret. smokey stares from the bar. do stray bottles tumble. I feel the misty spray. what a perfect, perfect day for the cabaret. from afar he sees. Venus rise overwhelmingly beautiful. he sighs the look of love was in her eyes. puts his hand upon her leg. looking closer his lust begins to fade. what a drag the queen did say.. could this be a dream Iâ€™m in? ( Fellini would be proud ). gluttony enfolds the scene. give them one last round ,. shining faces dance away. swinging skirts between the panted legs. kaleidescoping. then shassez in a blink the glasses fly. suddenly joy becomes a fight. there they tossed and turned a sight..
Steep is the water tower. painted off blue to match the sky. can't ignore the train. night walks in the valley silent. you could swear the earth just moved. can't ignore the train. dust to be kicked up. in the crack faced. idle sinister town. screen door to the rail station. devil in her shoe. ran along side the wasted tracks. hem pins darted her calves. can't ignore the train. one spoiled girl with the tidiest apology. some how wedged inside her throat. can't ignore the train. patience their virtue. but I never could abide by that. dungeon life with electric light. a clean towel and a basin. mantle figures mind their place. laughs where they belong. through adventure we are not adventuresome. rage to share with a wardrobe mirror. in a room so beige and cold. can't ignore the train. window days saw the children pick their. street games on thirty afternoons. Molly the boys are. starting in the rhymic again. teasing more and more..... the second daughter. how she fell. young locked in Some Folk's Prison. made to dwell. til they're braiding. her grey hair. sitting in the wishing chair. sitting in the wishing chair. sitting in the wishing chair.
If lust and hate is the candy,. if blood and love tastes so sweet,. then we give 'em what they want.. Hey, hey, give 'em what they want.. So their eyes are growing hazy. 'cos they wanna turn it on,. so their minds are soft and lazy.. Well, hey, give 'em what they want.. If lust and hate is the candy,. if blood and love tastes so sweet,. then we give 'em what they want.. So their eyes are growing hazy. 'cos they wanna turn it on,. so their minds are soft and lazy.. Well who do you wanna blame?. Hey, hey, give 'em what they want.. If lust and hate is the candy,. if blood and love tastes so sweet,. then we give 'em what they want.. So their eyes are growing hazy. 'cos they wanna turn it on,. so their minds are soft and lazy.. Well who do you wanna blame?
Over your shoulder, please don't mind me if my eyes have. fallen onto your magazine for I've been watching and wondering why. your face is changing with every line you read. All those lines. and circles, to me, a mystery. Eve pull down the apple and give. taste to me. If she would be wonderful, but my pride is in the. way. I cannot read to save my life, I'm so ashamed to say.. I live in silence, afraid to speak of my life of. darkness because I cannot read. For all those lines and circles,. to me, a mystery. Eve pull down the apple and give taste to me.. If she could it would be wonderful. Then I wouldn't need someone. else's eyes to see what's in front of me. No one guiding me.. It makes me humble to be so green at what every kid can. do when he learns A to Z, but all those lines and circles just. frighten me and I fear that I'll be trampled if you don't reach. for me. Before I run I'll have to take a fall. And then pick. myself up, so slowly I'll devour every one of those books in the. Tower of Knowledge..
I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.. And in that circle I had made were all. the worlds unformed and unborn yet.. A volume, a sphere that was the earth,. that was the moon, that did revolve around my room.. I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.. And in that circle was a maze,. a terrible spiral to be lost in.. Blind in my fear,. I was escaping just by feel.. But at every turn my way was sealed.. I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round.. And in that circle was a face.. Her eyes looked upon me with fondness.. Her warmth coming near,. calling me "sweetness," calling me "dear.". But I whispered, "no, I can't rest here.". I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round..
[ Robert Buck/Natalie Merchant ]. . Heaven, is this heaven where we are?. See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking.. Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves along the streets of heaven.. Where is the blessed table to feed all who hunger on earth,. welcomed and seated each one joyfully served?. See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking.. Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves along the streets of heaven.. Where is the halo that should glow 'round your face,. and where are the wings that should grow from your shoulder blades?. Show them to me.. These are sobering sights I've seen in the City of Angels. have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven.. There would have been heavenly music I was convinced before.. A host of the dearly to meet me with Hosannas sung at the door,. but these are sobering sights I've seen in the City of Angels. have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven.. In this city of fallen angels..
one time. you made me cry. be proud that I. remember. my chin is sore. the bruise is gone. but the spot is tender. gave my hand a sister coy. to Cotton Alley where. you did enjoy. your wicked games. you curious boy. tied my laces up together. when I fell. you laughed. until your belly was sore. in the brick laid aisle behind. the five and dime store. that's how. I made you blush. but doubt if you. remember. were my tears genuine. or those of a skilled. pretender. nothing precious. plain to see. don't make a fuss over me. not loud. not soft. but somewhere in between. say sorry. let it be. the word you mean. I was a little pest who. never took a hint. could never. take a hint. you pinched my fingers. in a door. tossed my coloring book in a. rusty barrel. pulled spiders from my hair. fingers in the door. my favorite blue blouse. stained on the back. running from a berry war. can you hear me scream. in Cotton Alley. scream in Cotton Alley. in Cotton Alley
Like a weasel in the clover You tilt toss. pop turn over Sit down Tremble and weave like a moth By flame deceived. Sit down Spill with your words caught up Dance in your room Slide like. you're buttered up Roll back the tomb Sit down Bolt scuff jilt chase. circle riddle Shake in haste Sit down When the thunderclouds sound. Ants scatter to high ground..
Chorus:. Did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night?. Dallas is a jewel. Yeah, dallas is a beautiful sight. Dallas is a jungle. But dallas gives a beautiful light. Did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night?. Now dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you’re down. But when you are up she’s the kind you wanna take around. Now dallas ain’t a woman to help you get your feet on the ground. And dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you’re down. Oh, I came into dallas with the bright lights on my mind. I came into dallas with a dollar and a dime. Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes. A steel concrete soul with a warm-hearted love in disguise. A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies. I say, dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his yes. Oh, I came into dallas with the brights lights on my mind. I came into dallas with a dollar and a dime. Chorus
There were women holding. rosaries On the day Manolette died Teenage girls in soft white dresses. Standing silent peace respecting Groups of boys held in their hands. The fragments of a shattered idol The old men with their traditions. challenged Refrained from tears Neck neck hook Poles of wood The. Picadores stood eyes ablaze To view brutal contest In the vale of. years Courage unfailing Agility exhausted Youth entered challenge. Reached for title shelved Patrons in attendance To disarm a common. myth Homage played to the victor of immortality Cloaked in bold tones. In the stockyard the beasts Did climb their barriers Bid by a frenzied. ring Bred for one purpose only To die in man's sport Dash against his. spindle An instant fell to wounding On the day Swords penetrating On. the day Torches igniting On the day Flower wreaths encircling The day. On the day..
[ original version by R.E.M. ]. Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus. Going to a place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough. Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't. know. You'll wind up in some factory that's full time filth and nowhere left. to go. Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself. I know it might sound strange, but I believe. You'll be coming back before too long. Don't go back to Rockville. And waste another year. At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend. I don't care if you're not here with me. 'Cause it's so much easier to handle. All my problems if I'm too far out to sea. But something better happen soon. Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back. It's not as though I really need you. If you were here I'd only bleed you. But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and. That's not how it ought to be. I know it might sound strange, but I believe. You'll be coming back before too long.
Don't talk, I will listen. Don't talk, you keep your distance. For I'd rather hear some truth tonight. Than entertain your lies,. So take you poison silently. Let me be let me close my eyes. Don't talk, I'll believe it. Don't talk, listen to me instead,. I know that if you think of it,. Both long enough and hard. The drink you drown your troubles. In is the trouble you're in now. Talk talk talk about it,. If you talk as if you care. But when your talk is over. Tilt that bottle in the air,. Tossing back more than your share. Don't talk, I can guess it. Don't talk, well now your restless. And you need somewhere to put the blame. For how you feel inside. You'll look for a close. And easy mark and you'll see me as fair game. Talk talk talk about it,. Talk as if you care. But when your talk is over tilt. That bottle in the air. Tossing back more than your share. You talk talk talk about it,. You talk as if you care. I'm marking every word. And can tell this time for sure,. Your talk is the finest I have heard. So don't talk, I'll be sleeping,. Let me go on dreaming. How your eyes they glow so fiercely. I can tell your inspired. By the name you just chose for me. Now what was it?. O, never mind it. We will talk talk. Talk about this when your head is clear. I'll discuss this in the morning,. But until then you may talk but I won't hear
I was walkin' down the street. Concentratin' on truckin' right. I heard a dark voice beside of me. And I looked round in a state of fright. I saw four faces one mad. A brother from the gutter. They looked me up and down a bit. And turned to each other. I say. I don't like cricket oh no. I love it. I don't like cricket oh no. I love it. Don't you walk thru my words. You got to show some respect. Don't you walk thru my words. `Cause you ain't heard me out yet. Well he looked down at my silver chain. He said I'll give you one dollar. I said you've got to be jokin' man. It was a present from me Mother. He said I like it I want it. I'll take it off your hands. And you'll be sorry you crossed me. You'd better understand that you're alone. A long way from home. And I say. I don't like reggae no no. I love it. I don't like reggae oh no. I love it. Don't you cramp me style. Don't you queer on me pitch. Don't you walk thru my words. `Cause you ain't heard me out yet. I hurried back to the swimming pool. Sinkin' pina coladas. I heard a dark voice beside me say. Would you like something harder. She said I've got it you want it. My harvest is the best. And if you try it you'll like it. And wallow in a Dreadlock Holiday. And I say. Don't like Jamaica oh no. I love her. Don't like Jamaica oh no. I love her oh yea. Don't you walk thru her words. You got to show some respect. Don't you walk thru her words. `Cause you ain't heard her out yet. I don't like cricket. I love it (Dreadlock Holiday). I don't like reggae. I love it (Dreadlock Holiday). Don't like Jamaica. I love her (Dreadlock Holiday)
I should know to leave them home. They follow me through the store. with these toys I can't afford. "Kids, take them back, you know better than. that." Dolls that talk, astronauts, T.V. games, airplanes, they don't. understand and how can I explain? I try and try but I can't save. Pennies,. nickels, dollars slip away. I've tried and tried but I can't save.. My youngest girl has bad fever, sure. All night with alcohol to cool. and rub her down. Ruby, I'm tired, try and get some sleep. I'm adding. doctor's fees to remedies with the cost of three day's work lost. I try and try. but I can't save. Pennies, nickels, dollars slip away. I've tried and. tried but I can't save. The hole in my pocketbook is growing.. There's a new wind blowing they say, it's gonna be a cold, cold one.. So brace yourselves my darlings, it won't bring anything much our way but. more dust bowl days.. I played a card in this weeks game. Took the first and the last. letters in three of their names. This lottery's been building up for weeks. I. could be lucky me with the five million prize, tears of disbelief spilling out. of my eyes. I try and try but I can't save. Pennies, nickels, dollars slip. away. I've tried and tried but I can't save. The hole in my pocketbook is. growing. There's a new wind blowing they say, it's gonna be a cold, cold one.. So brace yourselves my darlings, it won't bring anything much our way but. more dust bowl days..
Oh,. Baby blankets and. Baby shoes,. Baby slippers,. Baby spoons,. Walls of baby blue. Dream child in my head. Is a nightmare born. In a borrowed bed. Now I know. Lightning strikes again. It struck me once,. Then struck me dead. My folly grows inside of me. I eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. Walk for two,. Breathe for two,. Eat for two, now. Well, the egg man. Fell down off his shelf. All the good king's men. With all their help. Struggled 'til the end. For a shell. They couldn't mend. You know. Where this will lead,. To hush and rock. In the nursery. For the kicking. One inside of me. I eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. Eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. When the boy. Was a boy,. The girl. Was a girl,. They found. Each other in. A wicked world. Strong in some respects,. But she couldn't stand. For the way he begged. And gave in. Pride is for men. Young girls. Should run and. Hide instead. You risk the game. By taking dares with "yes". I eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. Eat for two,. Walk for two,. Breathe for two, now. I walk for two. I'm stumbling. I walk for two. I'm stumbling. Breathe for two. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Five months,. How it grows. Five months now,. I begin to show
We are the roses in the garden,. beauty with thorns among our leaves.. To pick a rose you ask your hands to bleed.. What is the reason for having roses. when your blood is shed carelessly?. It must be for something more than vanity.. Believe me, the truth is we're not honest,. not the people that we dream.. We're not as close as we could be.. Willing to grow but rains are shallow.. Barren and wind-scattered seed on stone and dry land,. we will be.. Waiting for the light arisen. to flood inside the prison.. And in that time kind words. alone will teach us,. no bitterness will reach us.. Reason will be guided another way.. All in time,. but the clock is another demon that. devours our time in Eden,. in our Paradise.. Will our eyes see well beneath us,. flowers all divine?. Is there still time?. If we wake and discover. in life a precious love,. will that waking become more heavenly?.
Eager to please was just the way that he was. though his attempts there falling short,. expectation. see he would tell of all his conquests,. was he bragging?. but in the evening all alone. Ellen unplanned delays. saving for someone who really cared about you. invincible they say. married to your name. she was the kind between a child and a lady,. quick was her temper. like a blaze from an ember. no one had measured to her standard,. so in the evening all alone all alone. how do I tell them to open their minds. and to take a chance. maybe on finding life`s treasure stubborn. they stay set in their ways. really not wanting to be lonely not alone.
Even with my eyes closed,. Funny how I know. it's harder, it's harder now.. Young girl. in my young girl days,. thinking I could live for always.. But like an ocean tide,. I'm drawn back inside. and I know.. Seasons pass. like sand inside a glass. and nothing, nothing returns.. Standing with the friends I've made,. I'll race them to the grave.. Well who won,. won the extra days?. But like an ocean tide,. I'm drawn back inside.... But like an ocean tide,. I'm drawn back inside. and I know.. When you the years toll. on the waters wide,. shallow high and low.. In the autumn sky,. happy to know I'm going home.. Even with my eyes closed,. funny how I know. it's finally,. has it finally begun?. But like an ocean tide,. I'm drawn back inside.... But like an ocean tide,. I'm drawn back inside. and I know.... and I know.... and I know....
Trudging slowly over wet sand. Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen. This is a coastal town. That they forgot to close down. Armagedon - come armagedon come armagedon come. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Hide on a promanade. Etch on a post card:. How I dearly wish I was not here. In the seaside town. That they forgot to bomb. Come, come nuclear bomb!. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Trudging back over pebbles and sand. And a strange dust lands on your hands. (and on your face). Everyday is like sunday. Win yourself a cheap tray. Share some grease tea with me. Everyday is silent and grey
why are some men born. with minds that earn degrees. the loving cups. gilded plaques. grace their study walls. hide the cracks. while their genius is turned. to works of tyranny then. off to market to market. go selling these. with words so fiery and persuasive. they steal cunningly. riches no one can exceed. and why are some men born. with a fate of poverty. one firm bed. for a swollen back. year by year. the bodies wracked while. their obedience is had. with gradual defeat. by the pace by the pace. and the urgency. through a muddled thought. they phrase it. God knows we're deceived. barter for. what they need. and where they go. disdain and jeering. for fools to call. the noble peasantry. o how it puzzles me. I pressed flat the accordion pleats. that had gathered in his cotton sleeves. while he thumbed. yes thumbed I wouldn't say caressed. the final piece. a mountain's crest. soon to reply assuredly. o for man aged ninety years. no words to waste on sermons. he'd be pleased to answer. short and sincere. girl there's a nonsense. in all these heaven measures. it's a heathen creed. so your grandma says. but better to live by.... drink it all in before it's dry. he ended there with a rattle. cough cough. I took away the long gone cold coffee cup. as a trail of Camel ashes fell. on the floor
Times are far between,. and few I bet,. when we can look upon our lives. without regret.. Of all the things I have done,. you think I'm proud. of everyone. without exception?. 'Till you make your peace with yesterday,. you'll never build a future.. I swear by what I say.. Whatever penance you do,. decide what it's worth to you. and then respect it.. However long it will take. to weather your mistakes,. why not accept it?. My hands, for now, are tied.. I'm a body frozen.. I'm a will that's paralyzed.. When will you ever set aside your pain and misery?. No matter how I beg,. no matter how I wish or plead,. you'll never be more than alive.. You'll never do more than survive. until you expect it.. Do you want to build a. world with our lives?. You better soon decide. or you can forget it.. My hands, for now, are tied.. I'm a body frozen.. I'm a will that's paralyzed.. 'Till you drop that heavy baggage. you're dragging behind,. there won't be room. for us to both go this ride..
by the time you say goodbye. by the time you say cheerio. we'll take a handshake through. on your journey as you go. keep a pray'r within your heart. that the time will surely fly. to the day when we shall meet again. by the time you say goodbye. hmmm...... yes listeners, we have been coming to you. live on a crystal ballroom high above the Hotel Jamestown. in picturesque western new york. as your program draws to a close. it gives me profound pleasure to say cheerio. to the strains of Miss Natalie Merchant and her choir. and so now it only remains for me to say... goodnight. by the time you say goodbye. by the time you say cheerio. we'll take a handshake through. on your journey as you go. keep a pray'r within your heart. that the time will surely fly. to the day when we shall meet again. by the time you say goodbye.
Waking on a train dreaming, charmed alone they started speaking.. Captured in his artist way before the memories fade away.. To remember a face, and you're home or want to.. Certain they would meet soon, paint a portrait of a family.. Sigle light on, single way, single light away.. The night fell.. Saw a painting on the stairwell to mourn the passing of a daughter dear.. Her soul upon the train so far so near.. Just close your eyes and you're home..
In the coolness of the morning sparing moments here in magical tide. I would meet you without question to share a starry gaze. a look through the sky from the start there was this kind of glow the start. when it's right you'll know,. fascinating love's a secret an ancient riddle with no reason. or rhyme unpredictable the muses. they play never knowing whether teasing or shy
[ Spoken intro from: Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey (by Lillian Schlissel) ]. "While the young folks were having their good times. some of the mothers were giving birth to their babies.. Three babies were born in our company that summer.. My cousin, Emily, gave birth to a son in Utah,. forty miles north of the Great Salt Lake one morning.. But the next morning she traveled on. 'til noon when a stop was made and another child was born,. this time Susan Mollmeyer.. And gave the baby the name Alice Nevada.". Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads.. Pass the lone church spire.. Pass the talking wire from where to who knows?. There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains.. Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces.. The land was free and the price was right.. Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly.. Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family.. I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.. Who were the homestead wives?. Who were the gold rush brides?. Does anybody know?. Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?. The land was free, yet it cost their lives.. In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters. they would moan as they would read accounts of. madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief..
An Augist day in the hills of Spain,. a pair of children emerged from a cave.. The strangest sight there alone they stood,. with skin of green and words no one had heard.. The girl was stronger, the boy was weak,. with her new mother she learned to speak.. And wove a tale of a dying sun,. they had left darkness, a dark world come undone.. They travelled so far.. Believing they came from a star.. She fell through life, through time, through parallel lives.. The men of science, the men of fame,. the men of letters tried to explain:. Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time. to make her think she'd fallen from the sky?. A whirlwind spun them all alone,. took them from their twilight home.. Believing they came from a star..

I always knew that you would take yourself far from home. as soon as, as far as you could go.. By the 1/4 inch cut of your hair and the Army issue green,. for the past eight weeks I can tell where you've been.. For I knew, I could see, it was all cut and dried to me. there was soldier's blue blood streaming inside your veins.. There is a world outside of this room and when you meet it promise me. you won't meet it with your gun.. So now you are one of the brave few,. it's awful sad we need boys like you.. I hope the day never comes for. "Here's your live round son.. Stock and barrel, safety, trigger, here's your gun.". Well I knew, I could see, it was all cut and dried to me. there was soldiers blue blood streaming inside your veins.. There is a world outside of this room and when you meet it promise me. you won't meet it with your gun taking aim.. For I don't mean to argue, they've made a decent boy of you. and I don't mean to spoil your home coming,. but baby brother you should expect me to.. "Stock and barrel, safety, trigger, here's your gun.". So now does your heart pitter pat with a patriotic song. when you see the stripes of Old Glory waving?. Well I knew, I could see, it was all cut and dried to me. there was soldier's blue blood streaming inside your veins.. There is a world outside of this room and when you meet it promise me. you won't meet it with your gun taking aim.. I don't mean to argue, they've made a decent boy of you. and I don't mean to spoil your homecoming my baby brother Jude. and I don't mean to hurt you by saying this again,. they're so good at making soldiers. but they're not so good at making men..
[ music: Natalie Merchant/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . In the dark night a giant slumbered untouched for centuries. 'til awakened by a white man's cry: "This is the Eden I was to find.". There were lands to be charted and to be claimed for a crown,. when a hero was made by the length he could stay in this dangerous land of hateful hate.. Curiosity filled the heads of these, there was an upper room they had to see.. Curiosity killed the best of these for a hero's hometown welcoming.. Still they moved on and on.. Who came building missions?. Unswerving men of the cloth who gave their lives in numbers untold so that black sheep entered the fold.. Captured like human livestock, destined for slavery.. Naked, walked to the shore where great ships moored for the hellbound journies.. Bought and sold with a hateful hate.. Curiosity filled the breasts of these with some strange ecstasy.. Curiosity killed the best of these by robbing their lives of dignity.. Still they moved on and on.. Calling men of adventure for a jungle bush safari.. Come conquer the, his claws and teeth.. See death in his eyes to know you're alive.. European homesteads grew up in the colonies with civilized plans for wild hinterlands, their guns and God willing.. Such a hateful hate.. Curiosity spilled the blood of these for their spotted skins and ivory.. Curiosity filled the heads of these madmen with the lies of destiny.. Curiosity spilled the blood of these, then blotted their lives from history.. Curiosity filled the heads of these, one man claimed all that he could see.. Curiosity still entices these madmen with a lusting and a greed.. Their legacy, legacy, legacy....
[ music: Natalie Merchant/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . To your common sense firm arguments. I won't listen to your voice of reason trying to change my mind.. I mind my feelings and not your words.. Didn't you notice I'm so headstrong even when I know I'm wrong?. Take this to your heart and into your head now:. before you waste your time, call a truce and call a draw.. What's the use in mapping your views out in orderly form. when it does nothing but confuse and anger me more?. I mind my feelings and not your words.. Didn't you notice I'm so headstrong.. You're talking to a deaf stone wall.. Take this to your heart and into your head now:. the old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it.. All is fair in love and war, that's how the famous saying goes.. Open up your eyes, see me for what I am:. cast in iron, I won't break and I won't bend.. Take this to your heart and into your head now:. the old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it.. All is fair in love and war, that's how the famous saying goes.. If I told you we were out to sea in a bottomless boat,. you'd try anything to save us, you'd try anything to keep us afloat.. And if we were living in a house afire,. I don't believe that you could rush out and escape it and not rescue me.. Take this to your heart and into your head now:. the old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it.. All is fair in love and war, that's how the famous saying goes.. Listen, I think they were talking to you..
[ John Prine ]. We had an apartment in the city. Me and Loretta liked living there. It'd been years since the kids had grown. A life of their own. Left us alone. John and Linda live in Omaha. Joe is somewhere on the road. We lost Davey in the Korean War. And I still don't know what for. dont matter anymore. Chorus:. You know that old trees grow stronger. and old rivers grow wilder everyday. old people, just grow lonesome. waiting for someone to say Hello in There. hello. Me and Loretta we don't talk much more. She sits and stares through the back door screen. And all the news just repeats itself. like some forgotten dream. that we've both seen. Someday I'll go and call up Rudy. We worked together at the factory. But what could I say if he asks "what's new?". "nothin what's with you?". nothin much to do. Chorus. So if you walking down the street some time. And spot some hollow ancient eyes. Please don't just pass em by and stare. as if you didnt care. Say hello in there. hello.
Hey Jack Kerouac. I think of you mother. And all the tears she cried. She would cry for none other. Than her little boy lost in a little world that hated. And that dared to drag him down. Her little boy courageous. He chose his words from mouths of. Babes got lost in the world. The hip-flash slinging madmen. Steaming café flirts. They all spoke through you. Hey Jack, now for the tricky part. When you were the brightest star. Who were the shadows?. Of the San Francisco beat boys. You were the favourite. Now they sit and rattle their bones. And think of their blood stoned days. You chose your words from mouths of. Babes got lost in the world. The hip-flask slinging madmen. Steaming café flirts. In Chinatown, howling at night. Allen baby, why so jaded?. Have the boys all grown up. and their beauty faded?. Billy, what a saint they made you. You're just like Mary down in Mexico. On All Souls' Day. You chose your words from mouths of. Babes lost in the world. The cool junk booting madmen. Street minded girls. In Harlem, howling at night. What a tear stained shock of the world. You've gone away without saying. Goodbye.
Music by 10,000 Maniacs - Lyrics by Mary Ramsey & John Lombardo. I see the leaves of autumn. changing, falling , turning what was green. I see a door standing open,. open to curiosity. we could be together. tear it all apart. would you ever notice. what was hidden in my heart. heartstrong. do we ever listen. closely as willows start to weep. there as we stood upon the threshold. who said forever was for keeps?. would you ever notice what. was hidden in my heart,. my deep heart is reeling forward. and steady on to keep,. who made me miss the last ferry?. who made this river so deep?. .
[ Merchant ]. . [ viola: Mary Ramsey ]. "My, how you've grown.". I remember that phrase from my childhood days too.. "Just wait and see.". I remember those words and how they chided me, when patient was the hardest thing to be.. Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost, I must let these memories provide.. No little girl can stop her world to wait for me.. I should have known.. At your age, in a string of days the year is gone.. But in that space of time, it takes so long.. Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost, I must let those memories provide.. No little girl can stop her world to wait for me.. Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind as the child that you never will be, you never will be again.. I'll never be more to you than a stranger could be.. Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind as a child that you never will be, will be again..
Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 'cause falling in love just makes me blue. Well the music plays. And you display your heart for me to see. I had a beer. And now I hear you calling out for me. And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. Well the room is crowded. There's people everywhere. And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?. Well if you sit down with this old clown. Take that frown and break it. Before the evening's gone away. I think that we could make it. And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. I can see that you are lonesome just like me. And it being late. You'd like some some company. Well I've had two, I look at you. And you look back at me. The guy you're with has up and split. The chair next to you's free. And I hope that you don't fall in love with me. And I hope that you don't fall in love with me. Now it's closing time, the music's fading out. Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout. Turn around to look at you. You're nowhere to be found. I search the place for your lost face. Guess I'll have another round. And I think that I just fell in love with you
[ Tom Waits ]. . Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,. Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see,. I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me. And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.. Well the room is crowded, people everywhere. And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?. Well if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it,. Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it,. And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.. Well the night does funny things inside a man. These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand,. Well I turn around and look at you, you light a cigarette,. I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met,. And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.. I can see that you are lonesome just like me, and it being late,. You'd like some some company,. Well I turn around and look at you, and you look back at me,. The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you's free,. And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.. Now it's closing time and the music's fading out. Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.. Well I turn around to look for you, you're nowhere to be found,. I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round. And I think that I just fell in love with you..
It crawls on his back, won't ever let him be.. Stares at the walls until the cinder blocks can breathe.. His eyes have gone away, escaping over time.. He rules a crowded nation inside his mind.. He knows that night like his hand.. He knows every move he made.. Late shift, the bell that rang, a time card won't fade.. 10:05 his truck pulled home.. 10:05 he climbed his stair, about the time he was accused of being there.. But I'm not the man.. He goes free as I wait on the row for the man. to test the rope he'll slip around my throat... and silence me.. On the day he was tried no witness testified.. Nothing but evidence, not hard to falsify.. His own confession was a prosecutor's prize,. made up of fear, of rage and of outright lies.. But I'm not the man.. He goes free as the candle vigil glows, as they burn my clothes.. As the crowd cries, "Hang him slow!" and I feel my blood go cold, he goes free.. Call out the KKK, they're wild after me.. And with that frenzied look of half-demented zeal,. they'd love to serve me up my final meal.. Who'll read my final rite and hear my last appeal?. Who struck this devil's deal?.
[ Merchant ]. . If you intend to live again,. then open your eyes and don't pretend you're feeling there's nothing worth believing.. God, if you persist you'll die like this,. and wither in the midst of your first season,. cut down with no reason.. How can you be so near and not see everything?. If you intend to live again,. then take the outstreched hand of the one that needs you.. It's been so long, we've missed you.. Why do you intend to speed your end?. Lie in the dark and let your limbs grow weaker, sinking low then deeper.. How can you be so near and not see everything?. Feel what might be. See what I see.. Again and again and again and again say you don't.. You say you don't, but you will.. How can you be so near and not see?.
lyrics/music - Mimi Fari&ntilde;a. In the quiet morning. there was much despair. and in the hours that followed. no one could repair. That poor girl. tossed by the tides of misfortune. Barely here to tell her tale. Rolled in on a sea of disaster. Rolled out on a mainline rail. She once walked tight by my side. I'm sure she walked by you. Her striding steps could not deny. Torment from a child who knew. That in the quiet morning. there would be despair. and in the hour that followed. no one could repair. That poor girl. she cried out her song so loud. it was heard the whole world round. [ A symphony of violence. The great southwest unbound ]. In the quiet morning. there was much despair. and in the hour that followed. no one could repair. That poor girl. tossed by the tides of misfortune. Barely here to tell her tale. Rolled in on a sea of disaster. Rolled out on a mainline rail.
To think of my task is chilling. To know I was carefully building the mask. I was wearing for two years, swearing I'd tear it off. I've sat in the dark explaining to myself. that I'm straining too hard for feelings I ought to find easily. Called myself Jezebel, I don't believe. Before I say that the vows we made. Weigh like a stone in my heart. Family is family, don't let this tear us apart. You lie there, an innocent baby. I feel like the thief who is raiding your home. Entering and breaking and taking in every room. I know your feelings are tender. And that inside you the embers still glow. But I'm a shadow, I'm only a bed of blackened coal. Call myself Jezebel for wanting to leave. I'm not saying I'm replacing love for some other word. To describe the sacred tie that bound me to you. I'm just saying we've mistaken one for thousands of words. And for that mistake, I've caused you such pain that I damn that word. I've no more ways to hide that I'm a desolate and empty. hollow place inside. I'm not saying I'm replacing love for some other word. to describe the sacred tie that bound me to you. I'm not saying love's a plaything. No, it's a powerful word. inspired by strong desire to bind myself to you. How I wish that we never had tried to be man and his wife. to weave our lives into a blindfold over both our eyes
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. Please don't take him just because you can. Your beauty is beyond compare. with flaming locks of auburn hair. ivory skin and eyes of emerald green. Your smile is like a breath of spring. Your voice is soft like summer rain. I cannot compete with you Jolene. Now he talks about you in his sleep. and there's nothing I can do to keep. from crying when he calls your name Jolene. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. Please don't take him just because you can. Now I can easily understand. How you could easily take my man. But you don't know what he means to me Jolene. Oh you could have your choice of men. but I could never love again. He's the only one for me Jolene. Well I have to have this talk with you. My happiness depends on you. and whatever you decide to do Jolene. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. Please don't take him just because you can.

He fills the flower vases, trims the candle bases, takes small change from the poor box.. Tyler has the key.. He takes nail and hammer to tack up the banner of felt scraps glued together reading,. "Jesus Lives In Me.". Alone in the night he mocks the words of the preacher: "God is feeling your every pain.". Repair the Christmas stable, restore the plaster angel.. Her lips begin to crumble and her robes begin to peel.. For Bible study in the church basement, hear children Gospel citing, Matthew 17:15.. Alone in the night he mocks the arms of the preacher raised to the ceiling,. "Tell God your pain.". To him the world's defiled.. In Lot he sees a likeness there;. he swears this Sodom will burn down.. Near Sacred Blood there's a dance hall where Tyler Glen saw a black girl and a white boy kissing shamelessly.. Black hands on white shoulders, white hands on black shoulders, dancing, and you know what's more.. He's God's mad disciple, a righteous title, for the Word he heard he so misunderstood.. Though simple minded, a crippled man, to know this man is to fear this man, to shake when he comes.. Wasn't it God that let Puritans in Salem do what they did to the unfaithful?. Boys at the Jubilee slowly sink into brown bag whiskey drinking and reeling on their feet.. Girls at the Jubilee in low-cut dresses yield to the caresses and the man-handling.. Black hands on white shoulders, white hands on black shoulders, dancing, and you know what's more.. Through the tall blades of grass he heads for the Jubilee with a bucket in his right hand full of rags soaked in gasoline.. He lifts the shingles in the dark and slips the rags there underneath.. He strikes a matchstick on the box side and watches the rags ignite.. He climbs the bell tower of the Sacred Blood to watch the flames rising higher toward the trees..

I saw a lovely maiden stray. across the fields at break of day. she softly sung her roundelay. the tide flows in. the tide flows out. twice every day returning. her cheeks were red. her eyes were brown. her hair in ringlets hanging down. upon her face to hide the frown. just as the tide was a flowing. the tide flows in. the tide flows out. twice everyday returning. a sailor's wife at home must bide. she halted heavily she sighed. "he parted from poor me , a bride. I'm widowed by the sea" she cried. just as the tide was a flowing. the tide flows in. the tide flows out. twice every day returning.

[ Iris DeMent ]. . [ From her debut album: Infamous Angel ]. Chorus:. Everybody's wondering what and where they all came from. Everybody's worrying 'bout where they're gonna go. When the whole thing's done. Nobody knows for certain,. And so it's all the same to me. I Think I'll just let the mystery be. Some say once gone, you're gone forever. Some say you're gonna come back. Some say you rest in the arms of the Savior. if in sinful ways you lack. Some say that they're comin' back in a garden. Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas. I Think I'll just let the mystery be. Some say they're going to place called Glory. And I ain't sayin' it ain't a fact. But I've heard that I'm on the road to purgatory. And I don't like the sound of that. I believe in love and I live my life accordingly. But I choose to let the mystery be.
The color of the sky as far as I can see is coal grey.. Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again.. With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my lips as if I might cry.. Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so I breathe.. Lately it seems this big bed is where I never leave.. Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. Quiver in my voice as I cry,. "What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away.". I hear the sound of a noon bell chime. Now I'm far behind.. You've put in 'bout half a day while here I lie. with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my lip as if I might cry,. "What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away?". Do I need someone here to scold me. or do I need someone who'll grab and pull me out of this. four poster dull torpor pulling downward.. For it is such a long time since my better days.. I say my prayers nightly this will pass away.. The color of the sky is grey as I can see through the blinds.. Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again. with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather.. A quiver in my voice as I cry,. "What a cold and rainy day. Where on earth is the sun hid away?". I shiver, quiver, and try to wake..

The sky was falling, heaven was calling.. When danger crashes, rose from the ashes.. Like two statues hidden inside ancient rock,. We were praying for the secrets to unlock.. And when the sun had turned its back on us,. In the dark our love kept track of us,. Pushed together by the lack of love.. We held each other tightly through our hell of dreams.. I still hear the never-ending echo of those screams.. But it's a life not made for reliving,. Its a life that makes your soul forgiving.. We sealed our bond from the beginning.. Aching, affection, vulnerable protection;. Falling, captured, crawling, rapture..

Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing.

Honor salute and speak. To the corner standing flag. Do you remember how the days of school were. Indivisible separate worlds. Compare contrast. These dreams absurd. Placid classroom faces. Breathe in the features. Of a demographics death map trilogy. Children read them well. Not to bury 3 of 4 sons. As the likes of chivalry. Not to take 6 of 30 bills. To manufacture Corpus Christi. And so you think it can be so serene. History's most intolerable famine. Has clutched our global tranquility. Reaped the lives of children. Maladies collaborate. With cyclic despair. Infanticide clamors to 20 times more. In 4th and 5th Worlds. The poor have always been. Beside us. Amid us. Death has always been. As million cease 15 million that's an annual reap. Add divide multiply sum 41 thousand!

In your. reckless eyes, you only have time and your love of danger -- to it. you're. no stranger.. In your reckless mind, you act as if you've got more lives. In your. reckless eyes, it's never too late for a chance to seize some final. breath. of freedom..
Out through the foggy window there just to see the eyes of my future children. looking back at me back through the foggy window. on and on miles pass years turn over. on and on there from that rolled down window ponies run free. cradled protectively there in the greenery somewhere I keep this picture. on and on miles pass years turn over. on and on for all the roads we've travelled. and all the bridges burned I was thinking out loud the ways. of the world that all seem so constant how few. of the lessons we really have learned.. out through the foggy window frozen in frame capturing passing pictures. life's last refrain, memories ashes scatter. on and on miles pass years turn over. on and on
Music by 10,000 Maniacs - Lyrics by Mary Ramsey & John Lombardo. This was once a city. harmony a common theme. but these complications. now make life a bit uneasy. hallowed buildings scrape the sky. voices ride the airwaves. once a city years gone by. will they still be standing in thecenturies ahead. going underground little children hiding,. bullets never meant for them. must there be such bloodshed in our hearts, our homes, ourheads?. will I be walking, walking so free?. this was a city once. this was once a city. harmony a common theme but these complications. once a city, once a dream..
Lineage closed. Dissolved In its birth. Tragedy. Prelude a balance Is a synergy. Of reason. Malicious hope. As techno atrocities. Lapse their effects. Associate these ends. Their clarity. Demands your revenge. Please compensate. Not. Deny. Jungle. Revenge. Infanticide. Crosses. Very thin walls. Latent casualties. Arrive. From fatal initiation. No longer recessive. Genetic aliens abandoned. Plain deceit. IN the mirage of. A just one time cause. We'd all changed. The clocks. No ladies auxiliary to kiss. Their blistered cheeks. Gone
[ Billy Bragg and Natalie Merchant ]. . In a busy street. A man sits down. Oblivious to the traffic sounds. No chaos. No frenzied shrieking crowd. Thank God their silence. Walking heads bent down. Come when they saw us. Called it lethargy. The treadmill turns. There down below their feet. Should I pray for an end to come. Quickly (quickly), quickly (quickly). Or cross the waves of an angry sea. Risking (risking). And braving (braving). The shipwreck and the mutiny assailing. Assailing. In a haunted doorway. And from the light of day. See another life fall to ruin in pain. False smiles from even children it seems. Landlocked ground for empty and lost dreams. A league against me. I hear him say. It's not worth half the effort. Or the price you pay. Should I pray for an end to come. Quickly (quickly), quickly (quickly). Or should I raise my face to the heavens above. And tell God (dear God). Stop jeering (and jeering). As our human frailties and all. Our failings. Are we failing?. Pound pound on an endless street. Again and again the nightmare scene. All strained against the tightened rope. Not one with a lasting lingering hope. There's evidence everywhere you see. Put a quarter down at the newsstand. So that you can read. Should I pray for an end to come. Quickly (quickly), quickly (quickly). Or should I raise my face to the clouds above. Entreating (entreating). Their mercy (some mercy). But as clouds will do. They'll rain down. First gently (gently) and sweetly (so sweetly). Until they silence me. With a burst of thunder (thunder) and lightning (and lightning). And helpless landlocked screaming. I know God must be agreeing. It's the worst part of watching. It's the worst part of watching. It's the worst part of watching. It's the worst part. Landlocked in screaming. God must be agreeing. To be helpless is the worst. Must be the worst part of watching. The worst part of watching.
[ Cat Stevens ]. . [ Banned from later U.S. copies of In My Tribe due to Cat Stevens' agreement to the fatwah issued against Salman Rushdie ]. Now I've been happy lately, thinking about the good things to come. And I believe it could be, something good has begun. Oh I've been smiling lately, dreaming about the world as one. And I believe it could be, some day it's going to come. Cos out on the edge of darkness, there rides a peace train. Oh peace train take this country, come take me home again. Now I've been smiling lately, thinking about the good things to come. And I believe it could be, something good has begun. Oh peace train sounding louder. Glide on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah. Come on now peace train. Yes, peace train holy roller. Everyone jump on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah. Come on now peace train. Get your bags together, go bring your good friends too.

I found this photograph. Underneath the broken picture glass. Tender face of black and white. Beautiful, a haunting sight. Looked into an angel’s smile. Captivated all the while. From the hair and clothes she wore. I’d place her in between the wars. Was she willing when she sat. And posed the pretty photograph?. Save her flowering and fair. The days to come, the days to share. A big smile for the camera. How did she know?. The moment could be lost forever. Forever more. I found this photograph. Stashed between the old joist walls. In a place where time is lost. Lost behind, where all things fall. Broken books and calendars. Letters script in careful hand. Music too, a standard tune by. Some forgotten big brass band. From the threshhold what’s to see. Of our brave new century?. The television’s just a dream. The radio, the silver screen. A big smile for the camera. How did she know?. The moment could be lost forever. Forever more. Was her childhood filled with rhymes. Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?. Was she innocent or blind. To the cruelty of her time?. Was she fearful in her day. Was she hopeful, did she pray?. Were there skeletons inside. Family secrets, sworn to hide?. Did she feel the heat that stirs. The fall from grace of wayward girls?. Was she tempted to pretend. The love and laughter, ’til the end?

"Mercy, mercy," why didn't we hear it?. "Mercy, mercy," why did we read it buried on the last page of our morning. papers?. The plan was drafted, drafted in secret.. Gunboats met the red tide, driven to the rum trade for the army that they. created.. But the bullets were bought by us, it was dollars that paid them.. Please forgive us, we don't know what was done,. Please forgive us, we don't know what was done in our name.. There'll be more trials like this in mercenary heydays.. When they're so apt to wrap themselves up in the stripes and stars and find that. they are able to call themselves heroes and to justify murder by their fighters. for freedom..

[ music: Dennis Drew/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . Tell me what's gone wrong.. I tilt my head there, under the faucet, but when I turn it on -- dry as paper.. Call the neighbors.. Who's to blame for what's going on?. In the dark without a clue I'm just the same as you.. O, they tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy and there's been a small spill.. Not a lot, no, just a drop.. But there you are mistaken, you know you are.. I wonder just how long they knew our well was poisoned but they let us just drink on.. O, they tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy and there's been a small spill.. All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea.. Someone's been a bit untidy, they'll have it cleaned up in a week.. But the week is over and now it's grown into years since I was told that I should be calm, there's nothing to fear here.. But I drank that water for years, my wife and my children.. Tell me, where to now, if your fight for a bearable life can be fought and lost in you backyard?. O, don't tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy, that there's been a small spill.. All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea.. Someone's been a bit untidy, they'll have it cleaned up in a week..
[ Lombardo/Merchant ]. . Oh my dear friend. My dear friend Giorgio. How has this time Breton. Discouraged your liaison with the. Eye styled metaphysical. Incongruous scenarios. Dauntly jaunt about through nostalgic despair. Within childlike renderings. Of a nightmarish recall. "All my images Fragments. I've shored upon my ruins. Pictor classicus sum. I am pure". Step solemn with the. Air of reluctant manes. As rod and hoop shadow children. Scatter through a henna arcade. Figures indentured to a windless landscape. Enduring silence and flame. Da Da da. No loyalty to the nonsensical. Scorned their nihilist pageantry.

On bended kneeI've looked through every window then.. Touched the bottom, the night a sleepless day instead. A day when love came,came easy like what's lost now found.. Beneath a blinding light that would surround.. We were without, in doubt. We were about saving for a rainy day.. I crashed through mirrors,. I crashed through floors of laughter then.. In a blind scene, no ties would moor us to this room.. A day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found.. And you would save me, and I held you like you were my child.. If I were you, defiant you, alone upon a troubled way.. I would send my heart to you. To save it for a rainy day..
A woman of beauty. A woman of pain. In france or jakarta. Her shadow’s the same. Chorus:. You go home with sally ann. You go home with sally ann. You go home. A woman of kindness. With bracelets of jade. In china or japan. Her choices are made. Chorus. A woman of chances. No family or friends. In argentina. She knows only men. Chorus. A woman of color. Debts to be paid. In trenton or detroit. She lives by the blade

Something was pulling me without knowing what was leading me on:. your shining light.. In my darkest hour the only way to bring the dawn was your shining light.. But you're unaware your shining light is even on.. Like with a little glance when you take me by surprise. and I take a chance and see it all through your eyes.. Free me from my history and show me where to draw the line,. by lighting up the mystery,. and you don't even know that it shines.. I'm not worried now about flying too close to the sun.. When December skies are cold,. you know I will always run to your shining light.. I won't abuse it so please just let it glow behind your smile.. Let me use it,. let me feel the warmth like a little child who understands your glance,. though it takes me by surprise.. And I take a chance and I see it all through your eyes..
When the day ends and church bells are ringing. when the valley is shrouded in snow,. when you're feeling that hope somewhere vanished. and there's no poetry left to console you,. with the smallest step you'll find a way oh of fate borne. and life is a jewel but stone will tarnish as dust will descend take a minute. and wipe free the lustre,. it'll mirror a day without end with the smallest step you'll feel. it starts a journey your way.. oh they tried to tell me but I'll learn for myself. and when they tried to tell me you know the words disappeared. on the wind I was running away. and when the laughter echoes through you in a pale beaming ray. and you'll know always and ever within you anyway
There like a feather you fell someone's heaven above me floating. so fickle tempting me teasing my ways thrown from. its clutches I struggle to free what escapes me. Absalom hanging like you I'm caught in between heaven. then earth then heaven between you release me untangle my hair. Absalom hanging like you I'm caught in between heaven. then earth heaven between you patient I wait. as I hold a small feather that floated from somebody's heaven
[ David Bowie ]. . Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low. I leaned back on my radio. Some cat was layin' down some rock'n'roll lotta soul, he said. Then the loud sound did seem to fade. Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase. That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive. CHORUS. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He told us not to blow it. 'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie. I had to phone someone so I picked on you. Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!. Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two. Look out your window I can see his light. If we can sparkle he may land tonight. Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright. CHORUS (2*).
That summer fields grew high with foxglove stalks and ivy.. Wild apple blossoms everywhere.. Emerald green like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as warm as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,. you'll never, you'll never know.. That summer fields grow high.. We made garland crowns in hiding, pulled stems of flowers from my hair.. Blue in the stream like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as bold as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,. you'll never, you'll never know.. You'll never know.. Violet serene like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.. There was no girl as warm as you.. How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need.. You'll never, you'll never know.. You'll never know.. That summer fields grow high.. We had wildflower fever. We had to lay down where they grow.. How I've learned to hide, how I've locked inside, you'd be surprised if shown.. But you'll never, you'll never know..
Frail hinges pivot. On a case's door. Commemorative. Souvenirs from places. Containers change with occasion. Cellophane encased. Displaying paper. Certificate. Credit years of service. A tool of central enterprises. The early hope. For permanence. The words the rings. Consistency. And. Social security. The miracles high tragedy. A thought mistaken for a memory. Dress lengths assassinations. Fractured family ties and christenings. Local posts will list your friends. In order of disappearance. Lawn scattered tins feed birds. The portion baked. For absent guests. The mass edition icon. God sent comfort. Your salvation. But who grants absolution. For sins that never were committed. Tension makes a tangle. Of each thought becomes. Inconvenience. Sound never penetrates. The servile edges break and faint. A thought mistaken for a memory. Clear the dust. From smiles in boxes. Pass the patterned wall. Recall their voices

[ music: Jerome Augustyniak/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . Detroit to D.C. night train, Capitol, parts East.. Lone young man takes a seat.. And by the rhythm of the rails, reading all his mother's mail from a city boy in a jungle town postmarked Saigon.. He'll go live his mother's dream, join the slowest parade he'll ever see.. Her weight of sorrows carried long and carried far.. "Take these, Tommy, to The Wall.". Metro line to the Mall site with a tour of Japanese.. He's wandering and lost until a vet in worn fatigues takes him down to where they belong.. Near a soldier, an ex-Marine with a tattooed dagger and eagle trembling, he bites his lip beside a widow breaking down.. She takes her Purple Heart, makes a fist, strikes The Wall.. All come to live a dream, to join the slowest parade they'll ever see.. Their weight of sorrows carried long and carried far, taken to The Wall.. It's 40 paces to the year that he was slain.. His hand's slipping down The Wall for it's slick with rain.. How would life have ever been the same if this wall had carved in it one less name?. But for Christ's sake, he's been dead over 20 years.. He leaves the letters asking, "Who caused my mother's tears, was it Washington or the Viet Cong?". Slow deliberate steps are involved.. He takes them away from the black granite wall toward the other monuments so white and clean.. O, Potomac, what you've seen.. Abraham had his war too, but an honest war.. Or so it's taught in school..
here is the store house of Her Majesty. well guarded by sentry. but looks are free. call this the rayless and benighted age. witches by tallow candles shifted. shifted their shapes. here is the pestle and mortar. that ground the poison seed. a lute, a suit for jousting. and the poems of a balladeer. when all the Latin books were copied off. in golden script. well hoarded away in. a monastery crypt. superstition. superstition beyond belief. over mountain, over dune and over sea. crude map and compass lead the caravan. and lead the fleet. here's the loot and plunder. they bore home. ivory tusk inlaid with precious stone. raw silk and spices by the barrel load. a soft skin drum with mallets. of human bone. a world wide rampage. rampage of greed. so here the tour concludes. The Colonial Wing. the rooms of the most refined. museum property. an early pair of spectacles. a claw footed divan. ornate clocks with birds that strut. on the half hours and quarter hours. hear them chime
Detroit, l.a.,boston, san francisco,. First time over the ocean on a plane. A billion stars below me lay,. Circle slowly jfk,. So much there to see inside of a week. They came looking for something new. Try to press it flat inside of a few days. Old dominion saturday, arlington's eternal flame. Sunday tour niagara falls in the mist.. Monday I'll be heading south. New orleans the cajun sound. Tuesday's tupelo elvis's home . .. Try to press it flat inside of a few days. What a wonderful stay,. On a mule grand canyon ride on wednesday,. Hope to get to denver in a day friday. Ride to washington, in the glacial mountain sun. Hop a train for canada to the east. They came looking for something new. Try to press it flat inside of a few days. What a wonderful stay.
Bent double like old beggars in sacks. Knockkneed and cursing or coughing like hags. Men marched on sleeping some without boots. Fatigue drunken deaf still to the hoots. Of breaking gas shells. Dropping softly behind. But limped on bloodshod. All went lame all went blind. Gas quick boys fumbling helmets in time. Someone still screaming a man in fire or lime. Under a grey cloud dim dark through green light. In all my dreaming before my helpless sight. He plunges at me. Choking guttering drowning. Put in a wagon he had to keep pace. As his eyes melt to his face. If you could hear blood. Gurgling from ruptured lungs. If you could witness. Vile sores on innocent tongues. You would not tell me. Not with such pride and such zest. The lies of history. Dulce et decorum est. Pro patria mori. Some desperate glory. Pro patria mori. As witness disturbs the story. Pro patria mori. Stand firm boys breathe the glory
[ music: Natalie Merchant & Dennis Drew/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . Can I be unhappy?. Look at what I see: a beast in furs and crowned in luxury.. He's a wealthy man in the poorest land, a self-appointed king,. and there's no complaining while he's reigning.. The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told.. There must be some creature mighty as you are.. The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share.. There must be some creature mighty as you are.. Can I be unhappy?. Listen and agree, no words can shame him or tame him.. The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told.. There must be some creature mighty as you are.. The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share.. There must be some creature mighty as you are, as you are.. Razor claws in velvet paws, you dunce in your guarded home,. 'til a stronger beast will call on you and pounce upon your throne.. Do we pay? Dearly, for the lion takes so greedily. and he knows that what he's taken, it is ours.. That's how the wealth's divided among the lambs and king of the beasts, it is so one-sided.. Until the lamb is king of the beasts we live so one-sided..
The Painted Desert can wait till summer.. We've played this game of just imagine long enough.. Wait till summer?. When I'm sure the rains have ended, the blooms have gone,. everyone killed by the morning frost.. Is a cactus blooming there in every roadside stand. where the big deal is cowboy gear won in Japan?. The Painted Desert can wait till summer.. We've played this game of just imagine long enough.. Wait till summer?. When I'm sure the rains have ended and the blooms have gone,. everyone killed by the morning frost.. Is a cactus blooming there upon the Northern rim. or in the ruins of the Hopi mesa dens?. You met a new friend in the Canyon, or so you wrote.. On a blanket in the cooling sand you and your friend agreed that. the stars were so many there they seemed to overlap.. The Painted Desert can wait till summer.. We've played this game of just imagine long enough.. Wait till summer?. When I am sure the rain has ended, the blooms have gone,. everyone killed by the morning frost.. Was a cactus blooming there as you watched the Native boy?. In Flagstaff trailer court, you wrote the line:. "He kicked a tumbleweed and his mother called. him home where the Arizona moon met the Arizona sun.". I wanted to be there by May at the latest time.. Isn't that the plan we had or have you changed your mind?. I haven't read a word from you since Phoenix or Tucson.. April is over will you tell me how long before I can be there?.
These are. These are days you'll remember. Never before and never since, I promise. Will the whole world be warm as this. And as you feel it,. You'll know it's true. That you - you are blessed and lucky. It's true - that you. Are touched by something. That will grow and bloom in you. These are days you'll remember. When May is rushing over you. With desire to be part of the miracles. You see in every hour. You'll know it's true. That you are blessed and lucky. It's true that you are touched. By something that will grow and bloom in you. These are days. These are the days you might fill. With laughter until you break. These days you might feel. A shaft of light. Make its way across your face. And when you do. You'll know how it was meant to be. See the signs and know their meaning. You'll know how it was meant to be. Hear the signs and know they're speaking. To you, to you
[ Jackson Browne ]. . I've been out walking. I don't do too much talking these days. these days, these days I seem to think a lot. about the things that I forgot to do for you. and all the times I had the chance to. I had a lover. well I don't think I'll risk another these days. these days if I seem to be afraid to live the life. that I had made in song. well it's just, it's just that I've been losing so long. looong...well..... I stop my dreaming. I won't do too much scheming these days. these days, these days I sit on cornerstones. and count the time quarter to's 'til ten, my friend. please don't confront me with my failures. I have not forgotten them.
I saw time turn so much there to unlearn,. you were envy you wouldn't say you tore heart strings. that sorry day dark light hid the tears one for each of the years. love has reasons reason never knows. time turns over love overflows I should have spoken sooner. on that sorry day your arms are open. and I wondered why. wondered why. five years passed to the day time heals some people say. when you hurt the ones I love you're also hurting me. and time turns over turning you from me I thought you'd never reach me. on that sorry day your arms were open wide and I wondered why
[original version by Lulu]. Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone. But in my mind I know they will still live on and on. But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to. perfume?. It isn't easy but I'll try. If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky. In letters that would soar a thousand feet high. To Sir, With Love. The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end. And as I leave, I know that I am leaving my best friend. A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong. That's a lot to learn - what can I give you in return?. If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start. But I would rather you let me give my heart. To Sir, With Love. Those awkward years have hurried by - why do they fly away?. Why is it, sir, that children grow up to be people one day?. What takes the place of climbing trees and dirty knees in the world. outside?. What is there for you I can buy?. If you wanted the world I'd surround it with a wall. I'd scrawl in words with letters ten feet tall. To Sir, With Love.
[ Merchant ]. . The still and silence is torn with violence.. A loud breaking sound in the night is made.. Hear it grow, hear it fade.. The sound you're hearing, the sound you're fearing. is the hate that parades up and down our streets, coming within bounds and within reach.. Now, inside the place we hide away, we hear it near and hope it turns away.. Turn away.... There's something seething in the air we're breathing.. We learn slash and burn is the method to use.. Set a flame, burn it new.. We're overpowered.. We kneel, we cower, we cover our heads.. Feel the threat of blows that will come and the damage that will be done in its wake.. Now, inside this place we hide away, we hear it near although it's miles away.. We hear it near and hope it turns away.. Turn away.... This house divided, we live inside it.. Hate's dwelling place is behind our door in fitful nights.. Hear it walk the floor and hear it rave as it moans and drags along its ball and chain,. as it moves through this house it can't escape.. Now inside this place we hide away.. We hear it near and hope it turns away.. Turn away.....
Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and your worries.. Trouble me on the days when you feel spent.. Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden. when my back is sturdy and strong?. Trouble me.. Speak to me, don't mislead me, the calm I feel means a storm is swelling;. there's no telling where it starts or how it ends.. Speak to me, why are you building this thick brick wall to defend me. when your silence is my greatest fear?. Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden. when my back is sturdy and strong?. Speak to me.. Let me have a look inside these eyes while I'm learning.. Please don't hide them just because of tears.. Let me send you off to sleep with a. "There, there, now stop your turning and tossing.". Let me know where the hurt is and how to heal.. Spare me? Don't spare me anything troubling.. Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and you worries.. Speak to me and let our words build a shelter from the storm.. Lastly, let me know what I can mend.. There's more, honestly, than my sweet friend, you can see.. Trust is what I'm offering if you trouble me.
[ Natalie Merchant ]. . [ piano: Don Grolnick/cello: Dennis Karmazyn/viola: Novi/bass: Bob Magnusson/string arrangement: David Campbell ]. The man in 119 takes his tea alone.. Mornings we all rise to wireless Verdi cries.. I'm hearing opera through the door.. The souls of men and women, impassioned all.. Their voices climb and fall; battle trumpets call.. I fill the bath and climb inside, singing.. He will not touch their pastry. but every day they bring him more.. Gold from the breakfast tray, I steal them all away. and then go and eat them on the shore.. I draw a jackal-headed woman in the sand,. sing of a lover's fate sealed by jealous hate. then wash my hand in the sea.. With just three days more I'd have just about learned the entire score to Aida.. Holidays must end as you know.. All is memory taken home with me:. the opera, the stolen tea, the sand drawing, the verging sea, all years ago..
That young boy without a name. Anywhere I'd know his face. In this city the kid's my favorite. I've seen him. I see him every day. Seen him run outside. Looking for a place to hide. From his father. The kid half naked. And said to myself. "O, what's the matter here?". I'm tired of the excuses. Everbody uses. He's their kid. I stay out of it. But who gave you the right. To do this?. We live on Morgan Street. Just ten feet between. And his mother. I never see her. But her screams and cussing. I hear them every day. Threats like. "If you don't mind. I will beat on your behind". "Slap you, slap you silly". Made me say. "O, what's the matter here?". I'm tired of the excuses. Everybody uses. He's your kid. Do as you see fit. But get this through. That I don't approve. Of what you did. To you own flesh and blood. I'm tired of the excuses. Everybody uses. He's your kid. Do as you see fit. But get this through. That I don't approve. Of what you did. To you own flesh and blood. "If you don't sit. In your chair straight. I'll take this belt. From around my waist. And don't you think. That I won't use it!". Answer me and take your time. What could be the awful crime. He could do at such young an age?. If I'm the only witness. To your madness. Offer me some words to balance. Out what I see and what I hear. All these cold and rude. Things that you do. I suppose you do. Because he belongs to you. And instead of love. And the feel of warmth. You've given him these cuts. And sores won't heal. With time or age. I want to say. "What's the Matter here?". But I don't dare say. "What's the Matter here?". But I don't dare say.
Everybody's wondering what. And where they all came from. Everybody's worrying 'bout. Where they're gonna go. When the whole thing's done. Nobody knows for certain. So it's all the same to me. Think I'll just let the mystery be. Some say once gone, you're gone forever. Some say they're gonna come back. Some say you rest in the arms of the savior. If in sinful ways you lack. Some say that they're comin' back in a garden. Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas. Think I'll just let the mystery be. Some say they're going to place called "glory". And I ain't sayin' it ain't a fact. But I've heard that I'm on the road to purgatory. And I don't like the sound of that. I believe in love and I live my life accordingly. But I choose to let the mystery be
Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving. But how can they know it's time for them to go?. Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming. I have no thought of time. For who knows where the time goes?. Who knows where the time goes?. Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving. Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go. But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving. I do not count the time. For who knows where the time goes?. Who knows where the time goes?. And I am not alone while my love is near me. I know it will be so until it's time to go. So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again. I have no fear of time. For who knows how my love grows?. And who knows where the time goes?
i will twine with your mingles of raven black hair. with the roses so red and the lilies so fair. with myrtle as bright as the emerald dew. the pale and the lyd-er and eyes of light blue. oh he promised to love me; he promised to love. and to cherish me always all others above.. i woke from my dream and my idol was clay. my passion for loving had vanished away.. oh he taught me to love him; he called me his flower. a blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour. but now he is gone and left me alone. the wild flowers to weep and the wild birds to mourn.. i will dance and i'll sing and my life shall be gay. i will charm every heart and each crown I shall sway. though my heart now is breaking he never shall know. how his name makes me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow.. i will dance and i'll sing and my heart will be gay. i'll banish this weeping, drive troubles away.. i'll live yet to see him regret this dark hour. when we won and neglected this frail wildwood flower..
[ music: Robert Buck/words: Natalie Merchant ]. . How did they teach you to be just a happy puppet dancing on a string?. How did you learn everything that comes along with slavish funnery?. Tell me something, if the world is so insane,. is it making you sane again to let another man tug at the thread that pulls up your nodding head?. How did they teach you to be just a happy puppet dancing on a string?. How do you manage to live inside this tiny stage you can't leave?. Tell me something, if the world is so insane,. is it making you sane again to let another man tug at the thread that pulls up your nodding head?. A dullard strung on the wire.. When the master's gone you hang there with your eyes and your limbs so lifeless.. How did they teach you to be just a happy puppet dancing on a string?. How do you manage to speak, your mouth a frozen grin?. A dullard strung on the wire.. When the master's gone you hang there with your eyes and your limbs so lifeless.. Tell me something, if the world is so insane,. is it making you sane again to let another man tug at the thread that pulls up your empty wooden head?. Your hollow head, your marble eyes, your wooden hands and your metal jaw pins. all wait in limbo for the man who knows how to move you this way..
I'd like to know what makes you stay. while your eyes still search for escape.. You think that I don't feel the cold,. but I wait while confessions unfold.. You'll never make a living from reading minds. or from getting your direction from exit signs.. Look into your heart and you won't find me there.. You won't find me where you hide. and that makes us a matter of time.. Like trees exposed by fall,. time reveals it all.. Tell me you want to do everything. but you're stuck up to your knees.. And I'm less likely pushed forward by ambition than a breeze.. But there's a flame that must be fanned,. and it appears as a beckoning hand.. Don't think 'cause you're not talking you're being kind,. you've been getting your direction from exit signs.. Look into your heart and you won't find me there..
It starts with pain, followed by hate. Fueled by the endless questions no one can answer. A stain covers your heart and tears you apart. Just like a sleeping cancer. I don't believe men are born to be killers. I don't believe the world can be saved. How did you get here and when did it start?. An innocent child with a thorn in his heart. What kind of world do we live in?. Where love is divided by hate. Loosing control of our feelings. We all must be dreaming this life away. In a world so cold. Are you sane, where's the shame?. A moment of time passes by you cannot rewind. Who's to blame and where did it start?. Is there a cure for your sickness. Have you no heart?. I don't believe men are born to be killers. I don't believe the world can't be saved. How did you get here and when did it start?. An innocent child with a thorn in his heart. What kind of world do we live in?. Where love is divided by hate. Selling our soul for no reason. We all must be dreaming this life away. In a world so cold, In a world so cold. There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape. It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way. So how many times must you fall to your knees?. Never, never, never, never, never do this again. It starts with pain, followed by hate. No I don't believe men are born to be killers. I don't believe that the world can't be saved. What kind of world do we live in. Where love is divided by hate. Losing control of our feeling. We're dreaming this life away. What kind of world do we live in. Where love is divided by hate. Selling our soul for no reason. We all must be dreaming this life away. In a world so cold. In a world so cold
Freedom!. Alone again again alone. Patiently waiting by the phone. Hoping that you will call me home. The pain inside my love denied. Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride. Everything I need it lies in you. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. I question why you chose to die. When you knew your truth I would deny. You look at me. The tears begin to fall. And all in all faith is blind. But I fail time after time. Daily in my sin I take your life. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. All the hate deep inside. Slowly covering my eyes. All these things I hide. Away from you again. All this fear holding me. My heart is cold and I believe. Nothing's gonna change. Until I'm broken. This time. Let go!. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. Broken. Broken. Broken. Broken
Biting the hand that feeds you, lying to the voice. Inside, reach out to beg for something this life. Is a lesson, take what you're given feeding on. Self destruction, waiting to explode again, no. Sign of resolution this life is a lesson, take what. You're given. You don't need direction to find your way, don't. You listen to yourself now and again killing. Time, killing you mind over matter, stop and. Listen to yourself now. Bend me before i breakdown, dying to be free. Within, it's not how you'd like to see it this life. Is a lesson, take what you're given forcing your. Self solution as you fall into line again, when. Will i find the answers this life is a lesson, take. What you're given. Falling to the ground, left face down as i recall. The mirrors ugly glare
You say you know just who I am. But you can't imagine. What waits for you across the line. You thought you had me. But I'm still here standing. And I'm tired of backing down. And I'm here now feelin' the pain. Of a thousand hearts. Been to hell and back again. I won't take this. You try so hard to bring me down. You can't break the broken. You still don't seem to understand. It's your turn to see just. How it feels to be me. How it feels to be knocked down. And you're here now feeling the pain. Of a thousand hearts. You've been to hell and back again. You can't take this. Remember. This feeling. How it feels to be alive. Now you see me through my eyes. And we're here now feeling the beat. Of a thousand hearts. Coming back to life again. We can make it. Remember. This feeling. Remember...

Looking for light in the darkness. Is something for fools. Searching for hope in a hopeless time. But now I'm through. Because I know I have something inside. Tô keep me from stumbling over my pride. And I'm dying tô believe. But now that it went away. I thought it would end all today. And I can feel the fight. Deep inside me giving way. And I don't wanna give in. But it's getting really hard. Tô give it all away. Nothing's coming back tô me. There was once a time. When everything seemed fine. Now I'm going back again. Tô this picture perfect place of mine. I won't believe something's wrong. When I know that it's true. And I know I can't lose a thing. If there's nothing tô lose. Nothing will keep me from chasing my dreams. And I will not give up on all of these things. That I'm trying tô achieve. But now that it went away. I thought it would end all today. And I can feel the fight deep. Inside me giving way. And I don't wanna give in. But it's getting really hard. Tô give it all away. Nothing's coming back tô me. There was once a time. When everything seemed fine. Now I'm going back again. Tô this picture perfect place of mine. But now that it went away. I thought it would end all today. And I can feel the fight. Deep inside me giving way. And I don't wanna give in. But it's getting really hard. Tô give it all away. Nothing's coming back tô me. There was once a time. When everything seemed fine. Now I'm going back again. Tô this perfect place of mine. Dying before my eyes. I reach tô make it mine. And now I'm going back again. Tô this picture perfect place of mine
Mother mother can you hear me,I keep trying. Just to find me all I know now, all you show me,. Endless questions, hopeless ending. This bitter pill is pushing me away and now I feel. Like there's nothing left to say and I pretend to. Look the other way but in the end will I be okay,. Will I be okay. Father father will you be there as I cry out. Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,. Numb to this dream sleeping within. Before I face another day, won't you let stay asleep,. Lost among the dreams that always comfort me. And before I find my feet, won't you show me. What I need, what I need to walk again
It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. I was sick of all the pain,. Tired of all the shame that I felt,. But you showed me the way,. To never have a doubt,. And always to believe in myself,. Now I see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. I'll become what I am because of you,. It was you,. I'm so sorry about the ways,. That I can't take away my past,. But you loved me anyway,. And now I want to do,. Everything for you that I can,. Even though it won't erase,. The foolish things that I've done,. Things that blinded me,. But now I see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. And I'll stand for what I know is real,. So how can I make this up to you,. I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,. Now that I'm living my life for you,. I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,. Can't you see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. I'll become what I am because of you,. I can see the writing on the wall,. As time begins to crawl away from me,. And I'll become what I am because of you,. It was you.
. I hear the words you say to me. I see the way you look at me. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I know the fear you hold inside. I know what's weighing on your mind. There's nothing you can do so. Stand up get up back up. You're reaching out just to be like me. But you've fallen short. Still you're following me. You had the chance to bring me down. But there's nothing left. So just stay away from me. You can't stand to see my face. To know you'll never take my place. There's nothing you can do but. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I feel the hate you push on me. I see the things that you can't see. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up. It's not the things you say to me. It's not the things that I believe. You try to bring me down. So stand up get up back up now Just stay away.
It's a long way back to reality, she puts another. Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago. Trying to figure out where things went wrong. Searching through all the lies she told. Somehow she missed out on all the things that. She needed most days spent wondering why this. Life is so cold and nothing ever changes. Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal. Yesterday. Hiding all emotion far away. Trying to find his self confidence, another. Broken heart behind the painless smile that he. Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone. And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he. Missed out on all the things he needed most days. Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and. Nothing ever changes. Tomorrow's still a miracle
I'm not okay but patiently I wait. I sit here hoping that we will be saved. Am I too late or am I just in time?. It's just too dark to see through blinded eyes. And I can't see you walk away. 'Cause you're already gone. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I'm awake, I saw you in my dreams. You came to me and never turned away. To be okay, something's gotta change. 'Cause with the lights on I still feel the same. I can't see you walk away. Tell me where did I go wrong?. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I stumble, you don't let me fall. Maybe you love me after all. I'll take whatever brings you back. Nobody makes me feel like that. Please don't ever let me lose your light. In this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. Now I see through open eyes. That without you here lately I'm blind. I'm okay and patiently I wait
Offer my hand you spit in my face. Blinded by failures you can't face the shame. The walls of your fortress come tumbling down. You cry for a savior no ones around. Paint me a picture of how things went wrong. 'cause this violence play your favorite song. Swim through the void as black as your soul. Never forget. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. Glued to the past a moth to a flame. Where will you hide. When you can't shift the blame. The further you fall the more that I gain. Never forget you've caused this pain. You feel. Burning deep inside of you. Behind the veil. Never take control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace
Lately I've been wandering. Off the narrow path. You've given me so many things that I've never had. And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through. If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!. (Come on). The world I know is pulling me. More and more each day. I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray. Spiteful eyes are watching me. With everything I do. In the midst of darkness Lord. My spirit calls for you. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!. (You know sometimes deep inside). I feel like this. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice. Yes I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life, Yeah!. The Way I feel. The Way.... The Way I feel
I came home early to see you,. Couldn't wait to hold you,. I've been away for so long now,. But as I walked through the doorway,. My heart was shattered,. To find that you're not alone,. When will I break into pieces,. Its your mistake,. I finally see that everything I thought was you was a lie,. Now your loves not dieing,. Its in the arms of a stranger,. The days just seem so much longer,. Now that I'm without you,. It never seems to get better,. I'll try to hold it together,. And I can't wait for,. The day you fade from my memory, yeah,. When will I break into pieces,. Its your mistake,. I finally see that everything I thought was you was a lie,. Now your loves not dieing,. Its in the arms of a stranger,. In the arms of a stranger,. In the arms of a stranger,. When will I break into pieces,. Its your mistake,. I finally see that everything I thought was you was a lie,. Now your loves not dieing,. Its in the arms of a stranger,. When will I break into pieces,. Its your mistake,. I finally see that everything I thought was you was a lie,. Now your loves not dieing,. Its in the arms of a stranger,. When will I break,. Its your mistake,. Everything I thought was you was a lie,. Now your loves not dieing,. Its in the arms of a stranger,. I came home early to see you, couldn't wait to hold you,. You're in the arms of a stranger.
Something. Keeps on pulling me down. And i feel. Like i'm losing ground. Trying. Just to find my reasons. And losing sense of what is real. Willing. To believe in something. Forgetting. To believe in me. Will i. Find my place in your mind. Or will i fall away in time. Chorus:. Now i'm feeling. So far away. And now i'm hating you. Every day. Waiting. Just to see the image. You follow. Down that road again. Trying. Just to find your purpose. You're fading faster every day. Willing. To believe in something. Forgetting. To believe in me. Will i. Find my place in your mind. Or will i fall away in time. Chorus. Now i feel i'm losing time. Yesterday. Slipped away. When you didn't know. Time and time again you wanted. More than i had to give. To leave me with nothing. I'm waiting. And dreaming. Yesterday. Slipped away. When you didn't know. And no more waiting. Let me back. Chorus x2. (Now i'm feeling). So far away x3. by juniorshould
There's a time in everybody's life. When nothing's going right for you. Take a chance. Take a step out on the ledge. Take a good look down. And realize it's all for you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. It's time, time to put the past away. Time to take all of your life's reel. And learn to live again. So alive as you open up your mind. As you break away from everything. All that's stopping you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. Time to fly. Time to kiss your fears goodbye. Time to take control and realize. This world was made for you. There's a time in everybody's life. When nothing's going right for you. Take a chance. Take a step out on the ledge. Take a good look down. And realize it's all for you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. Time to fly. Time to kiss your fears goodbye. Time to take control and realize. This world was made for you
Time moves slowly while you're gone. I haven't heard your voice in quite sometime. But I still see your face. I cannot erase the things you've done. And all the ways you caught me hangin on. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. I know it hurts to hear the truth. Well maybe I was never meant to be with you. And I cannot replace the tears of disgrace. That run for you. 'Cause running from the truth is what you do. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. You're all that I've ever known. And I cannot replace all these tears of disgrace. And I won't bleed for you anymore. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. . by:Milena Vieira
Say you love and hate me. As you desecrate me. Break me down with a smile. Feel it creeping closer. The rich taking over. You're out for blood with fire in your lungs. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive. Swear I hate to do this. With the same excuses. Anger swallows me whole. You feel it creeping closer. The rich taking over. You're out for blood with fire in your lungs. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive
Seems so simple, plant the seed. And let it grow. We can't control. The way we continue to be sold. Doesn't matter what you know because. You do just what you're told. Trusting in the insincere. Will leave you hopeless. How long until we finally wake up. Living in a world we made up. How much of this is real?. It's gonna be a long time. Until we all get over. Always getting one day older. With no one at the wheel, yeah. It's all but over. We're getting up and letting go. And our story's ending before it's even told. Doesn't matter what you do. If the choice is made for you. Trusting in the insincere. Will leave you hopeless. How long until we finally wake up. Living in a world we made up. How much of this is real?. It's gonna be a long time. Until we all get over. Always getting one day older. With no one at the wheel, yeah. How long. Are you gonna let 'em pull you down. Without a fight?. Come on. Are you gonna let 'em pull you down. Without a fight?. How long until we finally wake up. Living in a world we made up. How much of this is real?. It's gonna be a long time. Until we all get over. Always getting one day older. With no one at the wheel, yeah
Fear falls hard like rain again. Washing over me. You say nothing will ever change. What do i believe. You fall deep inside again. Nothing left to see. Weakness fills your heart again. You put it to rest. Chorus:. Forfeit everything. 'Cause you were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. And pray that i will not give up. I try to see your face again. A Photograph for me. Your voice calling out again. Nothing left for me. You try to find your place again. Waiting just to breathe. Weakness takes your heart again. You put it to rest. Locked inside again x3. Chorus x2. Did you forget about the things i said. Fight the lies inside your head. Deny those who try to bring you down. Kill the pain and emptiness. Find a love and lose yourself. Without this life you're just a memory. Locked inside again x3
It's so pathetic. In a million ways. What a desperate disgrace. Strung out, so proud, big mouth. Have we gone to far to change. Brainwashed. Like hollywood. Spreading through your neighborhood. Built up, burnt down, watch out. Now its gotten in our blood. Time is running out. It's running out, it's running out. I feel weak. I feel numb. Had enough. Of this poison we've injected. Living in this world infected. Out, let me out. Tell me how. We all got so disconnected. Sick of living in this world infected. It's systematic. Livin in this haze. Sleeping on a live grenade. Blacked out, face down, no sound. We're blowin up this place. How long. Can we endure. When we've tainted all that's pure. Selfish, high risk, death wish. What if no one finds a cure. Time is running out. It's running out, it's running out. I feel weak. I feel numb. Had enough. Of this poison we've injected. Living in this world infected. Out, let me out. Tell me how.

Don't pull my strings. I wanna know who died and crowned you king. You take this way too far and all your pain. Why do you take it out on me. You take it out on me, yeah. You're lighting up candles. Flying off the handle. Your crystal ball is lying. You can't control me. You can't hold me. Over your fire. No I'm not your voodoo doll. Not a victim strangled in your cloth. You think you got me underneath your spell. With your voodoo voodoo. You're playing dirty and your magic's black. I'm pulling needles out of my back. You think you cursed me but I won't fall. 'cause I'm not your voodoo voodoo doll. You know you haunt my dreams. Your so called power is not what it seems. Your darkest hour is not mine to face. So don't you take it out on me. Take it out on me, yeah. You're lighting up candles. Flying off the handle. Your crystal ball is lying. You can't control me. You can't hold me. Over your dying fire. No I'm not your voodoo doll.

You say you love me. Then burn me again. It's so easy to let you in. Now I'm standing at the end again. You lifted me up. You're tearing me down. I don't know where to go from here. Feeding the rage that hides within. You have finally locked me in. Will you ever let me go?. Pretty poison you're in my veins. Go away, go away. I don't need you anymore. You trap me, you haunt me, you trick me again. You're the reason I always give in. You have pushed me to the edge again. You lifted me up. You're tearing me down. I don't know where to go from here. Feeding the rage that hides within. You have finally locked me in. Will you ever let me go?. Pretty poison you're in my veins. Go away, go away. Won't you leave me for just one day?. Just one day?. Pretty poison you're in my veins. Go away, go away. I don't need you anymore. Leave me alone, leave me alone. All the voices inside my head. Leave me alone, leave me alone. All the voices inside my head. Pretty poison you're in my veins. Go away, go away. Won't you leave me for just one day?. Just one day?. Pretty poison you're in my veins. Go away, go away. Won't you leave me for just one day?. Just one day?. Pretty poison you're in my veins. Go away, go away. I don't need you anymore
Biting the hand that feeds you, lying to the voice. Inside, reach out to beg for something this life. Is a lesson, take what you're given feeding on. Self destruction, waiting to explode again, no. Sign of resolution this life is a lesson, take what. You're given. You don't need direction to find your way, don't. You listen to yourself now and again killing. Time, killing you mind over matter, stop and. Listen to yourself now. Bend me before i breakdown, dying to be free. Within, it's not how you'd like to see it this life. Is a lesson, take what you're given forcing your. Self solution as you fall into line again, when. Will i find the answers this life is a lesson, take. What you're given. Falling to the ground, left face down as i recall. The mirrors ugly glare

. I hear the words you say to me. I see the way you look at me. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I know the fear you hold inside. I know what's weighing on your mind. There's nothing you can do so. Stand up get up back up. You're reaching out just to be like me. But you've fallen short. Still you're following me. You had the chance to bring me down. But there's nothing left. So just stay away from me. You can't stand to see my face. To know you'll never take my place. There's nothing you can do but. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I feel the hate you push on me. I see the things that you can't see. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up. It's not the things you say to me. It's not the things that I believe. You try to bring me down. So stand up get up back up now Just stay away.
Mother mother can you hear me,I keep trying. Just to find me all I know now, all you show me,. Endless questions, hopeless ending. This bitter pill is pushing me away and now I feel. Like there's nothing left to say and I pretend to. Look the other way but in the end will I be okay,. Will I be okay. Father father will you be there as I cry out. Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,. Numb to this dream sleeping within. Before I face another day, won't you let stay asleep,. Lost among the dreams that always comfort me. And before I find my feet, won't you show me. What I need, what I need to walk again
Offer my hand you spit in my face. Blinded by failures you can't face the shame. The walls of your fortress come tumbling down. You cry for a savior no ones around. Paint me a picture of how things went wrong. 'cause this violence play your favorite song. Swim through the void as black as your soul. Never forget. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. Glued to the past a moth to a flame. Where will you hide. When you can't shift the blame. The further you fall the more that I gain. Never forget you've caused this pain. You feel. Burning deep inside of you. Behind the veil. Never take control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace
I'm not okay but patiently I wait. I sit here hoping that we will be saved. Am I too late or am I just in time?. It's just too dark to see through blinded eyes. And I can't see you walk away. 'Cause you're already gone. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I'm awake, I saw you in my dreams. You came to me and never turned away. To be okay, something's gotta change. 'Cause with the lights on I still feel the same. I can't see you walk away. Tell me where did I go wrong?. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I stumble, you don't let me fall. Maybe you love me after all. I'll take whatever brings you back. Nobody makes me feel like that. Please don't ever let me lose your light. In this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. Now I see through open eyes. That without you here lately I'm blind. I'm okay and patiently I wait
Freedom!. Alone again again alone. Patiently waiting by the phone. Hoping that you will call me home. The pain inside my love denied. Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride. Everything I need it lies in you. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. I question why you chose to die. When you knew your truth I would deny. You look at me. The tears begin to fall. And all in all faith is blind. But I fail time after time. Daily in my sin I take your life. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. All the hate deep inside. Slowly covering my eyes. All these things I hide. Away from you again. All this fear holding me. My heart is cold and I believe. Nothing's gonna change. Until I'm broken. This time. Let go!. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. Broken. Broken. Broken. Broken
Time moves slowly while you're gone. I haven't heard your voice in quite sometime. But I still see your face. I cannot erase the things you've done. And all the ways you caught me hangin on. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. I know it hurts to hear the truth. Well maybe I was never meant to be with you. And I cannot replace the tears of disgrace. That run for you. 'Cause running from the truth is what you do. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. You're all that I've ever known. And I cannot replace all these tears of disgrace. And I won't bleed for you anymore. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. . by:Milena Vieira

Open your eyes and see what you find. This chance has passed us by. We're lost again. When I come to mind what do you see. A prison or paradise. Honestly I don't want to know. So bury me, bury me down. I dare you to make believe you're better now. I dare you to. I think of the times that I saw you cry. A pain with no alibi. We lost control. But I'd rather die than go through this life. Knowing that I'm to blame. Honestly time won't change a thing. So bury me, bury me down. I dare you to make believe you're better now. I dare you to bury me, bury me down. I dare you to make believe you're better now. I dare you to. All this pain has pulled me under. All this pain has run me to the end. So bury me, bury me down. I dare you to make believe you're better now. I dare you to bury me, bury me down. I dare you to make believe you're better now. I dare you to. Open your eyes. See what you find
As I lie tossing in my bed. Lost in my fears remembering what you said. And I try to hide the truth within. The mask of myself shows its face again. Still I lie time and time again. Will you deny me when we meet again?. And I feel like I'm falling. Farther every day. But I know that you're there. Watching over me. And I feel like I'm drowning. The waves crashing over me. But I know that your love. It will set me free. As I find truth where I found it times before. As I search for your hope. I'm finding so much more. And I try to be more like you. And I deny myself to prove my heart is true. And I feel like I'm falling. Farther every day. But I know that you're there. Watching over me. And I feel like I'm drowning. The waves crashing over me. But I know that your love. It will set me free. I hear your voice calling. The time has come for me. Inside this life I'm living. There's nothing left for me. My mind is slowly fading. So far away from me. Each time I start crawling. You're there watching me. And I feel like I'm falling. Farther every day. But I know that you're there. Watching over me. And I feel like I'm drowning. The waves crashing over me. But I know that your love. It will set me free. . Por: @rafael_lm
Paint a perfect picture of. Everything I thought that this would be. But here's the truth. Its never easy. Strike a match. And light the fuse. As everything we were. Goes up in flames. And here's the truth. It's gonna kill me. Facing all my demon. Leaving all behind. I see now you're the reason. I don't wanna be here,. So I will move on. I'll be the last one. Standing. And I tasting your tears,. Now you're drowning your sorrows. And I'll just disappear. Tearing all your pictures of. All that's left of wasted memory. Of me and you. And this bitter ending. There must be a thousands ways. That we could watch our world come crashing down. But we found one. That's gonna kill me. Facing all my demon. Leaving all behind. I see now you're the reason. I don't wanna be here,. So I will move on. I'll be the last one. Standing. And I tasting your tears,. Now you're drowning your sorrows. And I'll just disappear. If I stay here with you.

Sometimes I feel so alone. Like a kid without a name. Despite all the scars that I let show. No one really knows my face. Because happiness is the mask. I choose to wear this time. To hide the hurt below. Cause there's a fire. That burns so deep inside. And the flames that rage. Are fueled by my pride. Yes, I need to let go. Of this consuming lie. But the bottle in my hand. Will get me through the night. In my life. I've walked down that road. Now I've go nowhere to go. I've going to be someone someday. But I might just have to wait. Because happiness is the mask. I choose to wear this time. To hide the hurt below. Cause there's a fire. That burns so deep inside. And the flames that rage. Are fueled by my pride. Yes, I need to let go. Of this consuming lie. But the bottle in my hand. Will get me through the night. It's drowning in me
See you look at me. With a look in your eyes. Like you've got an enemy in your sights. Now, I do not believe. This war will be over until you're forced to see. just how wrong you are. So you think you know who I am. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Back against the wall. Your guard begins to fall. But there's no sympathy. You're the enemy. You're my enemy. You're wanting to believe. I'm scared of what's coming. But I begin to see that you're weak. Now, don't show your teeth to me. It won't hide the fears. that are growing underneath. Your see-through pride. So you think you know who I am. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Back against the wall. Your guard begins to fall. But there's no sympathy. You're the enemy. You're my enemy. So you think you know who I am. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Back against the wall. Your guard begins to fall. But there's no sympathy. You're the enemy. You're my enemy. Time and time again. You push me to the end. But I feel better now. So much better now. So much better. You're my enemy!

Something. Keeps on pulling me down. And i feel. Like i'm losing ground. Trying. Just to find my reasons. And losing sense of what is real. Willing. To believe in something. Forgetting. To believe in me. Will i. Find my place in your mind. Or will i fall away in time. Chorus:. Now i'm feeling. So far away. And now i'm hating you. Every day. Waiting. Just to see the image. You follow. Down that road again. Trying. Just to find your purpose. You're fading faster every day. Willing. To believe in something. Forgetting. To believe in me. Will i. Find my place in your mind. Or will i fall away in time. Chorus. Now i feel i'm losing time. Yesterday. Slipped away. When you didn't know. Time and time again you wanted. More than i had to give. To leave me with nothing. I'm waiting. And dreaming. Yesterday. Slipped away. When you didn't know. And no more waiting. Let me back. Chorus x2. (Now i'm feeling). So far away x3. by juniorshould
There's a time in everybody's life. When nothing's going right for you. Take a chance. Take a step out on the ledge. Take a good look down. And realize it's all for you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. It's time, time to put the past away. Time to take all of your life's reel. And learn to live again. So alive as you open up your mind. As you break away from everything. All that's stopping you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. Time to fly. Time to kiss your fears goodbye. Time to take control and realize. This world was made for you. There's a time in everybody's life. When nothing's going right for you. Take a chance. Take a step out on the ledge. Take a good look down. And realize it's all for you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. Time to fly. Time to kiss your fears goodbye. Time to take control and realize. This world was made for you

How long has it been. Inside these walls again. As I waited here for you. I gave up all my friends. I drove them to the end. I have nothing left to lose. Told me to hold your hand. And you would pull me through, yeah. I have nothing left to lose this time. Hello suicide, how long will you be. Please don't take your time. Stealing this cold life from me. How long has it been. Inside these walls again. As I waited here for you. I gave up all my friends. I drove them to the end. I have nothing left to lose. Told me to hold your hand. And you would bring me through, yeah. I had nothing left to lose this time. Hello suicide, how long will you be. Please don't take your time. Stealing this cold life from me. Hello suicide, how long will you be. Please don't take your time. Stealing this cold life from me
Hey hey love,. Lookin back on everything i've done,. Never thought i'd find the one,. To share the dreams thas only i'd seen,. Locked in the deepest part of me,. I took a chance to lay it on the live,. There was nothing left to hide behind,. If you never love, then you may never lose,. And I hope i'll always be with you,. And I'm screaming,. Hey love,. Won't you leave your touch on this heart that's broken,. I can't breathe when you're not here,. Hey love won't you lift me up on the wings that fly high,. And on the stars that shine above,. Hey hey love,. Thinkin back on all the things we've done,. We watched the waves drown the sun,. We shared the dreams that both of us had seen,. Made it a reality,. We found a way to stand the test of time,. All of our doubts were left behind,. If you never love, than you may never loose,. And I hope i'll always be with you,. And I'm screaming,. Hey love,. Won't you leave your touch on this heart that's broken,. I can't breathe when you're not here,. Hey love won't you lift me up on the wings that fly high,. And on the stars that shine above,. If darkness should fall upon our hearts,. Remember the dreams from the start,. Hey love,. Won't you leave your touch on this heart that's broken,. I can't breathe when you're not here,. Hey love won't you lift me up on the wings that fly high,. And on the stars that shine above,. Hey hey love,. I can't breathe when your not here,. Hey hey love.
You're waiting for someone to guide your steps. Reality won't let you catch your breath. You beg and you plead just to catch a break. To never be free with the choices you made. Fall down, give up, you hesitate. Destined to repeat the same mistakes. But in my mind I believe that it is your time. To pick yourself up and get back in the race. Hey, man are you too afraid to lead the way. Into the waters that drown the weak. Facing the nightmares that steal your sleep. Hey, man are you strong enough to face the pain. Rise to the challenge that lies ahead. Or will you give in again. Just open your eyes and then take the leap. You're in control of your destiny. Doing your best doesn't mean you'll succeed. You'll always fail if you live on your knees. If you fall down, you can get up. Don't hesitate. Refuse to repeat all the same mistakes. If in your mind you believe. That it is your time. To pick yourself back up. And get back in the race. Hey, man are you too afraid to lead the way. Into the waters that drown the weak. Facing the nightmares that steal your sleep. Hey, man are you strong enough to face the pain. Rise to the challenge that lies ahead. Or will you give in again. Hey, man are you too afraid to lead the way. Into the waters that drown the weak. Facing the nightmares that steal your sleep. Hey, man are you strong enough to face the pain. Rise to the challenge that lies ahead. Or will you give in again. Give in again
In my eyes you see the pain. With each lie I take the blame. With each sigh I slowly fall away. You are there when I need you. You sew me up when I bleed through. The endless cloth of lies surrounding me. Everything that I am you have given me. The lessons that I've learned are bringing me home. It's everything that I need. It's all the truth that I believe. Right where I need to be. Just bring me home. I hide in darkness blind to sense. Chasing a dream with false pretense. Help me find the fracture in this dark sky. Everything that I believe is slowly overtaking me. I'm just trying to find my way back home. Endless days are haunting me. Open eyes and I can't sleep. I need this now rescue me. Just bring me home. You can't bring me down. ‘Cause I'm going home. It's everything that I need. It's all the truth that I believe. Right where I need to be. Just bring me home. Endless days are haunting me. Open eyes and I can't sleep. I need this now rescue me. Just bring me home
Seems so simple, plant the seed. And let it grow. We can't control. The way we continue to be sold. Doesn't matter what you know because. You do just what you're told. Trusting in the insincere. Will leave you hopeless. How long until we finally wake up. Living in a world we made up. How much of this is real?. It's gonna be a long time. Until we all get over. Always getting one day older. With no one at the wheel, yeah. It's all but over. We're getting up and letting go. And our story's ending before it's even told. Doesn't matter what you do. If the choice is made for you. Trusting in the insincere. Will leave you hopeless. How long until we finally wake up. Living in a world we made up. How much of this is real?. It's gonna be a long time. Until we all get over. Always getting one day older. With no one at the wheel, yeah. How long. Are you gonna let 'em pull you down. Without a fight?. Come on. Are you gonna let 'em pull you down. Without a fight?. How long until we finally wake up. Living in a world we made up. How much of this is real?. It's gonna be a long time. Until we all get over. Always getting one day older. With no one at the wheel, yeah
Close your eyes my lonely friend. I sympathize but look deep within. Think of your life where it begins. It's not the end. It's not the end. Take a step and don't look down. You can turn it all around. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you. I'm with you. I know it hurts, you're broken inside. But no kind of pain's worth more than a life. Take the first step and breathe in again. It's not the end. It's not the end. Take a step and don't look down. You can turn it all around. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you. I'm with you. Take a step and don't look down. You can turn it all around. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you. I'm with you. Take a step and don't look down. You can turn it all around. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you.
You've gone too far. To fall apart. I know it's hard to see. Through today. You gave it all. You broke your heart. When I was here. And I promise you. If I could be everything to you. I would find a way 2x. If I could proove. That you felt the same. I would be the one 2x. If I could. I felt this thing. For far too long. And now it's going to bless. You never knew. You held my heart inside your hand. I've never felt like this. And I promise you. (Chorus). Cause I would never do. The things he did to you. I would never let you go. (Chorus)
Step back inside the lie again, you'll find you're. Wearing thin. Killing the sympathy as you take another swing. At me now. Fighting your inner self again, losing what. You feel. Shielded behind the lies that make you feel real. Now. It's over and i don't feel a thing but you're. Trying to break the scar again your spirit is. Bleeding as you grin but your bridge keeps on. Burning at both ends. In your mind, the ending seems to be so far from. What you need. Take back the memories as you smile to hide the. Pain from me now. Shut down the curiosity that brings you here. Again. No sense of purity as you try to take the life. From me now. Nothing that you ever say could ever possibly. Erase. All the hateful things you did and now i'm. Through with you nothing you could ever say. Nothing you could ever say. Hope you're happy now
I'm reaching out without a sound. My pride falls to the floor again. Inside my mind I search to find. A place just to call my own. Deep inside your eyes. I am blinded by your love. Still I run so far just to find that. I'm alone again. In my head. I hear you calling me. And I can't run ‘cause there's nothing left for me. When I fall you always follow me deep inside. Deep inside. Deep inside of my head. I just can't last as these feelings pass. Once again I hide the pain inside. The smile wears thin and the lies begin. To bring me down again. When I run I run so far away from you. I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again. And all my faith I put in you. This time you take it all away. Inside my head. Deep inside. My head
It's so pathetic. In a million ways. What a desperate disgrace. Strung out, so proud, big mouth. Have we gone to far to change. Brainwashed. Like hollywood. Spreading through your neighborhood. Built up, burnt down, watch out. Now its gotten in our blood. Time is running out. It's running out, it's running out. I feel weak. I feel numb. Had enough. Of this poison we've injected. Living in this world infected. Out, let me out. Tell me how. We all got so disconnected. Sick of living in this world infected. It's systematic. Livin in this haze. Sleeping on a live grenade. Blacked out, face down, no sound. We're blowin up this place. How long. Can we endure. When we've tainted all that's pure. Selfish, high risk, death wish. What if no one finds a cure. Time is running out. It's running out, it's running out. I feel weak. I feel numb. Had enough. Of this poison we've injected. Living in this world infected. Out, let me out. Tell me how. We all got so disconnected. Sick of living in this world infected
It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. I was sick of all the pain,. Tired of all the shame that I felt,. But you showed me the way,. To never have a doubt,. And always to believe in myself,. Now I see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. I'll become what I am because of you,. It was you,. I'm so sorry about the ways,. That I can't take away my past,. But you loved me anyway,. And now I want to do,. Everything for you that I can,. Even though it won't erase,. The foolish things that I've done,. Things that blinded me,. But now I see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. And I'll stand for what I know is real,. So how can I make this up to you,. I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,. Now that I'm living my life for you,. I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,. Can't you see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. I'll become what I am because of you,. I can see the writing on the wall,. As time begins to crawl away from me,. And I'll become what I am because of you,. It was you.
Yesterday we watched the colours fade. As shadows danced across your fragile face. And on the inside we're dying. Just to let you know we're there. And that we care (that we care). So close your eyes. And drift beyond the stars and light our way. We'll be okay (we'll be okay). The love you shared was strong and true. We're who we are because of you. Wake me up when its over. I swear I should have told her. Everything she has meant to me, yeah. Take me back to october. When I could have told her. Everything she has meant to me. Goodnight my sweet lerlene. All the places that I've seen. Will never compare to the dreams. And vivid memories. Of the words you said that set me free. We all struggle in this life. Breathing doesn't mean you're alive. Hold on to the ones you love. Chase your dreams. The love you shared was strong and true. We're who we are because of you. Wake me up when its over. I swear I should have told her. Everything she has meant to me, yeah. Take me back to october. When I could have told her. Everything she has meant to me, yeah. Wake me up when its over. I swear I should have told her. Everything she has meant to me, yeah. Take me back to october. When I could have told her. Everything she has meant to me. Goodnight my sweet lerlene
I feel so alone again. I know that I need you. To help me make it through at night. As I pray. That you believe in me. You gave me my strength. To face another day alone. And I need you now my friend. More than you know. When will we meet again. Cause I can't let go of you. This world brings me down again. I know that I need you. To help me make it through at night and I know. That you're the one for me. You gave me my strength. To face another day alone. And I need you now my friend. More than you know. When will we meet again. Cause I can't let go. I can't let go. As life passes by I find. Rainbows seem to change. When I feel alone. You bring me back to you. And I need you now my friend. More than you know. When will we meet again. Cause I cant let go of you. No I can't let go
Our candle burns away, the ashes full of lies. I gave my soul to you. You cut me from behind. No where to run. No where to hide. You're scared of the truth. I'm tired of the lies. Cause who I am. Is where you wanna be. Don't act like an angel. You're fallen again. You're no superhero. I've found in the end. So lie to me once again. And tell me everything will be alright. Lie to me once again. And ask yourself before we say goodbye. Well goodbye. Was it worth it in the end?. You said you were there for me. You wouldn't let me fall. All the times I shared with you. Were you even there at all?. No where to run. No where to hide. You're scared of the truth. I'm tired of the lies. Cause who I am. Is where you wanna be. Don't act like an angel. You're fallen again. You're no superhero. I've found in the end. So lie to me once again. And tell me everything will be alright. Lie to me once again. And ask yourself before we say goodbye. Well goodbye. Was it worth it in the end?. Why'd you have to up a run away?. A million miles away. I wanna close my eyes and make believe. That I never found you. Just when I put my guard away. It's the same old story. You left me broken and betrayed. It's the same old story. Don't act like an angel. You're fallen again. You're no superhero. I've found in the end. So lie to me once again. And tell me everything will be alright. Lie to me once again. And ask yourself before we say goodbye. Well goodbye. Was it worth it in the end?. Lie to me once again. It's the same old story. Lie to me once again. It's the same old story. Was it worth it in the end?
Desperate and waiting, frozen to the core, numb. To this feeling, needing something more all i. Keep thinking is where i need to be, all i can hope. For is someone to take me away. Before you go you promise me something, i need. To know will you leave me lifeless leaving me. Lifeless. Will i bow down to this life that i live, will i find. Freedom or lose it all again all i keep thinking is. Where i need to be, all i can hope for is someone. To take me away. Before you go you promise me something, i need. To know will you leave me lifeless time moves so. Slow, i'm waiting for something, waiting for. Something again. Will i fall away from you, feelings that i never. Knew and i hope that i never fall away
Little Eyes. See through me again. They know all of my sin. As I try to hide it away again. And I know that youæŠ®e there. And I see how much you care. But I throw it all away again. What I really know(chorus). Say you need me. When IæŠ¦ far away. Something I hold deep inside of me. When IæŠ¦ alone. I pray that you can see. The life that I lead. Each time I try to turn awayLittle Eyes are begging me to stay. But I tell myself itæŠ¯ OKThis time. I hide behind the mask I wear. So blind....I never see you there. And now you are just like meOh Yeah. What I really know. (chorus). Little Eyes x4. What I really know x4.
We all pretend that the world's not changing. We all believe we deserve much more. But deep inside there's no denying. The rising tides have reached our shores. Get in line and set the outcome. Feed the rich and rob the poor. Tell myself that it's not worth fighting. When will we wake up?. Why can't we see there's more. To life than misery?. How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. "what has this world done for me? ". We close our eyes as the kids are dying. We pull the shades and lock the doors. We all complain as we sit in silence. We cheat the game while keeping score. Get in line and set the outcome. Feed the rich and rob the poor. Tell myself that it's not worth fighting. When will we wake up?. Why can't we see there's more to life. Than misery?. How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. "what has this world done for me? ". Why can't we see there's more to life. Than misery?. How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. "what has this world done for me? "
I find myself in question again. And I doubt this Love you've given to me. I hope you understand when I say. I need this time to myself. You speak your mind to me again. You force your words so deep within. You try to tell me how to live. But it's my life. I know your open arms too well. Cause I've lost myself there many times before. I need to slowly fall away. Far from the grip you have on me. You speak your mind to me again. You force your words so deep within. You try to tell me how to live. But it's my life. I find these words were never true. I've lost all my respect for you. I need to find my own way. It's my life. I gotta get away. One step away. I gotta get away. Just one step away. I gotta away you're pushing me away. I gotta get away. Well I'm gone
